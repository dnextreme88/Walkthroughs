==Night Elf Campaign==

===Chapter 1: Rise of the Naga===

The 1st chapter of the campaign of the expansion contains a handful of secrets. All of these secrets are found using Maiev\'s Blink spell.

*You can find this at the very start of the chapter. After destroying the gate, keep moving right on the destroyed bridges. You will be ambushed by Mur\'gul creeps if you stay on the edge of the shore. On the northeast-most bridge, go to the edge and blink to a small piece of land you see to get to a hidden island. Here, move slightly north and kill the lone Mur\'gul creep near the rocks. Now move south and destroy the crate here for a Tome of Intelligence. When you see a Rune of Mana at the edge of this island, blink to it and move closer to the edge to see another island and blink to it once again. Destroy the crate here and the Mur\'gul creeps will ambush you. They will be dropping a ''Ring of Protection +1 (Armor +1)'', Rune of Mana and Rune of Greater Healing. Simply backtrack your way by using blink again to get back to the main road.

*After your 1st encounter with Naga enemies, head over to the northeast side. You will see an island you can blink into. Do that and kill the lone Naga Siren and it will drop a Rune of Mana and Tome of Strength. Blink back to where you came from.

*You will see a Fountain of Health along the way. Move closer to the 1st waterfall on the bottom of the fountain. Blink to the patch of land you see and kill the spiders here. One will drop a ''Claws of Attack +3 (Damage +3)''. Blink back to the Fountain of Health.

*Don\'t go just yet. There's another item you can get to near the fountain. Blink to the northern-most waterfall to see another set of spiders you can kill. One will drop a ''Spider Ring (Agility +1)''.

*After getting the optional quest for rescuing the captive Sentinels being held hostage by the satyrs, head over to the edge of a tree just before the 1st Satyr creep you see. Blink as far as you can on a patch of land on the other side of the tree. You will land on a secluded space, where a Furbolg Hermit is found. Kill the Furbolg Hermit and it will drop ''Healing Wards (3 charges)''.

===Chapter 2: The Broken Isles===

*Sail to the northwest-most of the map using your transport ships. You can find 3 Tome of Intelligence at different platforms behind the library. If you blink to any of it, you will get a message 

=--SECRET FOUND--=
Hidden Tomes of the Ancients
=-=

You need to use "iseedeadpeople" cheat to blink to it, as it is impossible to blink to it without exploring that area first.

===Chapter 4: Wrath of the Betrayer===

*You will receive an optional quest to find excavation sites and kill Naga excavators. When you find the 1st excavation site and slay the Naga enemies, grab the dropped Staff of Teleporation item and use it to teleport to the lower part of your base. Let Maiev travel south and blink to the top of a waterfall. You will find a purple Naga base. Keep heading south until you see 2 Naga enemies behind a Spawning Ground structure. Blink to the waterfall beside it and you will get a message 

=--SECRET FOUND--=
Keeper of the storms shrine
=-=

Move further and kill the Naga Royal Guard. Destroy the gate behind it and claim the 3 gold caches (500 each) you can use for your base.

*While you're here, move north to a small opening to reveal a canal. Blink to this canal and go west to find a Tome of Agility and Rune of Mana. Simply blink back to the Naga base.

*Don't leave the base just yet. Move south behind the gold mine to see another opening. Just follow this area. You will need a Hippogryph to reveal the fog of war so that Maiev can blink to the unexplored terrain. At the end of this canal is a ''Mantle of Intelligence +3 (Intelligence +3)'' and Rune of Mana.

*After letting Maiev and her warriors to the boats, move forward and kill the 2 Couatls on your way. Move east through a small opening there and follow this path. You will end up in front of a massive gate. Destroy this gate and move further for a short cutscene. Fight off the secret Infernal here. It will drop a ''Runed Bracers (33% magic damage to the hero is reduced)'' upon killing it.

*Back to the main sea, keep sailing south, there will be stairs on your way. Drop your units here and kill the Naga enemies here. Have a Huntress use her Sentinel spell on the tree to reveal a Tome of Strength above. Simply blink to the platform to grab the tome.

*Don\'t destroy the gate on the bottom part of the map yet. Head left and kill the Naga enemies at the bottom. Go near the torch and blink to where the Pandaren Brewmaster is. You will get a message

=--SECRET FOUND--=
Pandaren drinking area
=-=

then he will leave a ''Slippers of Agility +3 (Agility +3)''.

*After destroying the last gate, head east and follow this path. There are 2 Naga Sirens along the way so kill them. Blink to the other side. You will be in an area of full flowers along with a critter named "Grank the Rat". Don't bother attacking it as it won't die. However, if you keep clicking on this critter multiple times, it will explode and will drop a ''Talisman of Evasion (15% of attacks to the hero misses)''.

===Chapter 5: Balancing the Scales===

*When you reach an intersection after an encounter with Naga enemies, use Malfurion\'s Force of Nature on the trees in the middle. Kill the Sea Elemental creeps here and grab the Tome of Strength/Agility/Intelligence +2, ''Circlet of Nobility (+2 to all abilities)'' and Minor Replenishment Potion.

*Move north to the Naga base. There will be a waterfall on the east side. Blink to the platform behind this waterfall. Destroy the barrels here. One of the barrels here contain a Tome of Agility +2.

*If you're good at invisibility and control, you can wait for night time and Shadowmeld past these enemies. Find a patch of trees. North of these trees is a platform you can blink into. Blink into the other side and destroy the middle barrel that drops an ''Amulet of Spell Shield (blocks a negative spell every 40 seconds)''.

===Chapter 6: Shards of the Alliance===

*Kael will rendezvous troops at a small village. Move behind the large building on the north and you will see a small opening. Follow this path until you see 3 crates. Destroy the crates and one of the crates will drop a ''Ring of Regeneration (+2 HP regen/sec. of the hero)''.

*You will be ambushed by Crypt Fiends after passing the 2nd mercenary camp. Kill them and find a lone tree in the west side of the road. You will notice a small patch of land with a crate that you can't get across (the terrain is steep). Blink to it and destroy the crate to reveal an ''Orb of Fire (+5 bonus fire damage to the hero's attacks)''.

*After an encounter with a Frost Wyrm and his lackeys, use your Mountain Giants to grab the trees just south of the cavern the Undead forces came from. You will eventually find a lone camping site. Destroy the crates here and one of the crates will drop a ''Talisman of Evasion (15% of attacks to the hero misses)''.

*You will come across to an intersection. Take the north path and you will find a bunch of creeps behind a Goblin Merchant. Kill them and look for a small stone wall just beside the structure. Use your Mountain Giants to grab the trees. You have to continue grabbing the trees from the east until you see a platform that you can go up to. Do the same for these patches of trees and you will fight a hidden Bandit Lord. He will drop a Rune of Restoration and ''Claws of Attack +12 (Damage +12)'' upon death.

===Chapter 7: The Ruins of Dalaran===

*Move south of your base. You will find Forest Troll creeps here. Kill them and destroy the barrel behind them and you will find a Tome of Agility.

*Go all the way east of Kael's base. There will be a gold mine with Stonemaul Ogre creeps here. Kill them and one of them will drop a ''Claws of Attack +9 (Damage +9)''.

*Move north this time (where you will be saving the Paladin in the optional quest). At the entrance, take the south gate. Kill the Kobold creeps here and destroy the crates on the corner on the east side. One of them contains a Tome of Strength +2.

*Take the north path this time and save the Paladin. Bring a Huntress with you. Fight through the Naga enemies here and kill the Naga guarding a gate. Destroy the gate and the Paladin will join forces with you. Use the Huntress' Sentinel ability and cast it on the south mushroom on this cellar to reveal a platform above. Blink to it and destroy the crates and barrels here. They drop a Rune of Mana, Potion of Greater Healing, Potion of Greater Mana and ''Robe of the Magi +6 (Intelligence +6)''.

==Human Campaign==

===Chapter 1: Misconceptions===

*On the southeast corner of the map, look for a greenish tree beside a destroyed cage. You will see a small opening you can pass. You will find a Bundle of Lumber (250 lumber) here.

*After the cutscene with Naga, don't go to the ships just yet. Instead, move west until you see a rock. Move south past this rock and you will find a unique creep called "Moss Covered Granite Golem". Beware, this is a level 15 creep (this will prove a fight for the forces you currently have, so just come back here when you have built a base on the island). He will drop a Rune of Greater Resurrection, Rune of Greater Healing and ''Claws of Attack +3 (Damage +3)'' upon death.

*Sail to the west just below the Undead base. Fight your way across the Ogre creeps here. After killing the 3rd set of Ogres, move south and destroy the 2 cages here. 2 Riflemen will join forces with you.

===Chapter 2: A Dark Convenant===

*On the southwest corner of the map, you can find rock chunks. Use your Naga forces to swim underwater and destroy these chunks. You will fight a hidden Ancient Hydra here. Kill it and it will drop a Mana Stone, ''Ring of Regeneration (+2 HP regen/sec.)'' and Tome of Agility +2.

*Similar as above, except this time you have to travel on the northeast corner of the map. You will fight 2 Thunder Lizards and 1 Storm Wyrm (who will come out of the cave on the north). Upon killing the Storm Wyrm, he will drop a ''Pendant of Energy (+150 mana)''.

===Chapter 3: The Dungeons of Dalaran===

*At the start of the chapter, head west. Destroy the egg sacs on the west side of this hall. One of sacs will drop a ''Ring of Protection +1 (Armor +1)''.

*Before going, kill the large Green Spider creep and it will drop a ''Medallion of Courage (Strength +4, Intelligence +4)''. Just be wary, as your forces are still thinned and it's a difficult battle because the egg sacs will spawn Spider creeps every once in a while, but you will get a nice reward for slaying the creep.

*On the hall where Garithos' guards are fighting the Undead, move west into another hall. Destroy the leftmost gate and destroy the sacs inside. One of the sacs will drop a ''Claws of Attack +3 (Damage +3)''.

*You will encounter another large battle between Garithos' guards and the Undead. If you go south of this battle and through the iron gate on the left you will see 3 sheep. Click the platforms in front of them in this order: TOP -> BOTTOM -> MIDDLE. The iron gate to the north will then open. Pick up the question mark to receive the message 

=--SECRET LEVEL FOUND--=
You have unlocked a secret mission. Complete this mission to play
=-=

*After the battle, kill the Footman before he reaches for the lever. Destroy the gate behind it and kill the next set of Garithos' guards. Don't leave just yet, use Kael's Flame Strike ability on the mushrooms on where the guards were. This will reveal a Rune of Restoration and a light blue rune. Step on it with 1 of your units. Have another unit backtrack all the way to the north, until you see a demonic gate. Step on the light blue rune here and the gate will open. There's an Arcanite Golem here (but it will only drop a Rune of Healing upon death). Destroy the 3 crates here and they contain the following:

**''Frost Wyrm Skull Shield (Armor +2, 33% magic damage to the hero is reduced)''
**''Shamanic Totem (Allows the hero to cast Purge)''
**''Essence of Aszune (Allows the hero to heal itself every time it's casted upon)''

===Secret Level: The Crossing===

*If you managed to beat all enemy waves in this secret level, you will be rewarded a free level 5 Pandaren Brewmaster hero on the next chapter.

===Chapter 6: Lord of Outland===

*On the first hall where Akama and his Draenei troops destroy the 1st generator during the cutscene, head west. Move further behind the Fountain of Mana to find a massive Abomination called Butcher. Behind him is an item called ''"Wirt's other leg"'', which is a reference to a boy named Wirt from Diablo 2. The item doesn't give any stats though.

*Move south to where Butcher was. Destroy the cages here to release 2 Draenei Watchers for you to command.

*On Lady Vashj's side, move north and destroy the small outpost of Watch Towers commanded by the Purple Fel Orc enemy. Move east on the Fountain of Health then follow it south. You will have 2 of each gold coins (250 each), Tome of Strength, Tome of Intelligence and Tome of Agility in succession.

Then destroy the tome pedestals on the sides. They contain a Tome of Intelligence and Tome of Agility.

*Once you get the 1st Shade, continue moving east until you see a gate to the north. Destroy the gate and step on the platform. A platform will be raised nearby. Move south until you see a Fountain of Mana then move east. Follow this narrow path and grab the ''Boots of Quel'Thalas +6 (Agility + 6)'' on the end.

*On the intersection with an Iron Gate and an Orb of Venom item on the middle, take the east path. Kill off the enemies here then head south on this intersection. You will come across a Tomb of Relics (which you can actually destroy if you want to). Move west to rescue a lone Crypt Fiend for you to command. Move south to a narrow passage and step on the platform at the end. This will elevate the platform you crossed earlier before the 1st intersection. Keep moving west and follow this path. Grab the ''Pendant of Energy (+150 mana)'' at the end.

*Go back to the previous intersection and take the north path this time. Kill the enemies here then head west. Look for a small patch of trees near the iron gate. Use your Ghouls or Meat Wagons (if you finished the side quest) to remove the trees. Hidden behind these trees is a ''Circlet of Nobility (+2 to all abilities)''.

*Continue moving west. Destroy the barrels just before the Fountain of Health to the north to reveal a Rune of the Revenant. Picking this up will automatically summon an Ice Revenant for 120 seconds.

*On the gate with 2 Nerubian Towers, take the west side. Destroy the crates found here. The west crate will drop a Rune of the Revenant while the south crate will drop a Tome of Strength.

*Take the east side this time. Kill the enemies here and destroy the cages at the far end. 2 Ghouls will join you.

*Don't go just yet. Use your Ghouls or Meat Wagons to destroy a small patch of trees behind the cages. Target the trees on the south. Once cleared, it will reveal a hidden ''Periapt of Vitality (+150 health)''.

===Chapter 3: The Dark Lady===

*Move east on your base. Look for a burning warehouse. Destroy the crate beside it to reveal a ''Skull Shield (Strength + 1)''.

*One of the map's creep lords, Blackthorn could be a possible reference to another video game by Blizzard Entertainment entitled ''"Blackthorne"''.

*There are 2 ways to Varimathras' base. One is near Zul'Rogg's hideout and the other one is on the south. Take the south path and look for a burning warehouse. Destroy the crates here. One of them will reveal a ''Mantle of Intelligence +3 (Intelligence +3)''.

===Chapter 4: The Return to Northrend===

*Behind the Tuskarr creeps are penguins. Slay the Large Penguin and it will drop a ''Ring of Superiority (+1 to all abilities)''.

*The 1st Red Blood Elves enemy base holds lots of barrels. Destroy the barrels on the west side and one of them will reveal a Tome of Intelligence +2.

Follow this path and take the east side on the intersection. Destroy the gate here and a mini cutscene will commence. The Penguin King will drop a ''Ring of Protection +4 (Armor +4)''.

==Bonus Campaign==

===Act 1: To Tame a Land===

*Head northwest from Thrall's encampment. Kill the Centaur creeps here. Destroy their huts here and one of which will reveal an item called ''"Clockwork Penguin"''. Clicking on the item will just play a Penguin critter sound. The item is useless.

*On the Ogrimmar Tunnels map, head to the northwest corner of the map. Look for 3 mushrooms near the river. Use your Goblin Sappers' Kaboom! Ability to destroy the mushrooms. It will reveal a ''Ring of Superiority (+1 to all abilities)''.

*Don't leave just yet. This time, head to the bottom southeast corner of the map. Look for a group of mushrooms below a rock. Use your Goblin Sappers' Kaboom! ability again to destroy it. It will reveal a ''Claws of Attack +6 (Damage +6)''.

===Act 2: Old Hatreds===

*On the Coastal Base map, look for an Altar of Kings building on the east side of the village. Destroy the building and it will reveal a ''Crown of Kings +5 (+5 to all abilities)''.

*On the Tidefury Cove map, transport your units to one of the provided Orc Transport Ships. Head north until you see a small island to the east. There's a uniquely named Goblin Merchant building called ''"Wizbang's Island Treasure Shop"''. This could be a reference to Wizbang Cranktoggle, an NPC quest giver in World of Warcraft, another Blizzard Entertainment game.

===Act 3: A Blaze of Glory===

*On the Kul Tiras Blockade map, drop off to the island and look for a gold mine. Move north here and you will find barrels. Destroy the barrels and one of them will reveal a ''Glyph of Omniscience''. This will reveal the entire map, similar to inputting the cheat "iseedeadpeople".

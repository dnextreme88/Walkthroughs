==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Fortune Doll Locations FAQ for Mystical Ninja starring Goemon. This guide will help you find all the fortune dolls located within the game. For a game this old, this is my 1st FAQ for the Nintendo 64 (yes, it is old but looking at the gameplay and its critical reception, it's worth writing a guide for an old video game console).

==Fortune Dolls==

The list is sorted in the chronological order in which you can obtain them. Also, some fortune doll require certain requirements to be able to reach them and they are listed too.

Nabbing all 45 Fortune Dolls will not only give you a full health of 20 hearts, but will also allow you to fight all the Impact bosses from the ''Options'' menu upon completion of the game.

Take note that once you enter space, you can't collect any of the previous dolls. Be sure that you have all of them before proceeding (you should have 18 hearts before heading into space).

Your ''Strength Gauge'' will increase by 1 for every 4 silver fortune dolls and for every single gold fortune dolls you collect.

I recently watched Tom's stream on YouTube playing the game and hunting for fortune dolls that he is missing. It seems that he found an alternate way of collecting the #12 Fortune Doll as well as pointing out mistakes for the #13 and #42 Fortune Dolls. Thank you!

[That's...]

Mog: "What a suspicious looking doorway..."

Mog: Wait, this must be the entrance to a dungeon! Yes, that's it! I've finally found it!

Mog: Yep, my gut feeling was right. Yep, that's right...

Mog: Yep, my gut feeling was right.

Mog: "You think so too, don't you ...?"

Mog: "Hey... Are you listenin' to me?"

Mog: "Hey........."

Mog: "[player name], you weren't listening, were you? Whatever..."

Mog: "Searching the world for treasure...

Mog: Hardly finding any rare items... It's been a long journey...

Mog: As a rare item collector, it'd be such a cryin' shame to pass up a dungeon like this...

Mog: Okay, let's go, [player name]!"

Mog: "Wha...! Whatever, let's go!"

Mog: "Whaddya doin'? You're comin' along too!"

===1F (Mysterious Dungeon)===
Mog: "What!? The stairs we came down are gone?"

Mog: "This must be another mysterious dungeon."

Mog: "What!? You forgot?

Mog: "In mysterious dungeons, stairs from the previous floor disappear.

Mog: There may be monsters, too. Despite all that, you can get a lot of rare items."

Mog: "Well, to put it simply, you can get lots of tasty food."

Mog: "Alright, let's move it!"

Mog: "Huh? What now, [player name]?"

Mog: "What? Why are you in the lead, you ask?"

Mog: "That's the way it always is. Come on [player name]!"

===2F (Mysterious Dungeon)===
Mog: "Ha ha, this dungeon's no big deal."

Mog: "Huh... what's that?"

Mog: (Oh shoot! Get down!)

Mog: (Just do it!)

Mog: (That Goblin's pickin' on that Guz...)

Mog: (Oh no! It took out that Guz and leveled up!)

Mog: (Shh!)

Mog: If a monster takes out another monster, it goes up in level!

Mog: A Goblin becomes a Dark Goblin... We'll never beat it, let's scram!)

===4F (Mysterious Dungeon)===
Mog: "What? You say we're stuck in here!?"

Mog: "Let's see here..."

Mog: "Hey, you can get through no problem."

Mog: "It looks too narrow, but you can go through diagonally."

Mog: "Come on, move it."

===6F (Mysterious Dungeon)===
Mog: "Oh! Oh! This switch looks like it might do something."

Mog: "It'll stink if its a trap though..."

Mog: "But...it just might give me some treasure.

Mog: Alrighty...

Mog: Here goes nothin'!!

Mog: "Hey, [player name]?"

===After being rescued===
Girl: "Good, you're awake."

Girl: "I was so surprised when you fell from the sky.

Girl: But you seem to be okay now."

Girl: "?

Girl: This is probably your first time seeing a human, isn't it?"

Girl: "Even so...running from the person who helped you is kinda mean.

Girl: The way I see it, a bird like you is a lot more unusual than me."

Girl: "You're not a bird? You're [player name]...?"

Girl: "Oh, I see. My name is...

Shiroma: "I'm [Shiroma name] and I'm a White Mage. Nice to meet you [player name].

Shiroma: You look very healthy, I guess the tonic worked well enough."

Shiroma: "Well, I'm relieved.

Shiroma: Well, I'm going out. If you're tired, rest on the bed."

Shiroma: "Oh yes, don't drink the tonic on the shelves, it's bad."

===4F (Mysterious Dungeon, 2nd visit)===
Chubby Chocobo: "No way... You don't know what'll show up next!

Chubby Chocobo: "I've had enough of this dungeon. I'm goin' home.

Chubby Chocobo: "And that skeleton that burst outta the dark, and...!

Chubby Chocobo: "Waaghhhh!"

Shiroma: "What!?"

Shiroma: "Whew... That was close."

Chubby Chocobo: "Th, that's why I don't like this place...

Chubby Chocobo: The only reason I came this far is 'cus you asked me to."

Shiroma: "Hmph... What kind of chocobo are you?

Shiroma: Get a hold of yourself.

Shiroma: Wasn't it you who came along so happily when I told you there would be plenty of nuts to eat?"

Chubby Chocobo: "Uhhh, that's..."

Shiroma: "Fine. I'll continue on by myself then."

Chubby Chocobo: "No, it's too dangerous."

Shiroma: "I'll be fine. I have a Teleport Tag if I run into any problems."

Shiroma: Besides, I want to find this dungeon's secret. Therefore I must go."

Shiroma: "You be careful, too."

Chubby Chocobo: "Wait a sec! But... she's gone..."

Chubby Chocobo: "Oh, I don't know. What should I do? I'm scared by myself..."

Chubby Chocobo: "A monster!!!"

===6F (Mysterious Dungeon, 2nd visit)===
Shiroma: "Oh! What are you......?"

Shiroma: "Do you have business in this dungeon, too?"

Shiroma: "Have I seen your friend? Hmm... I haven't, but...

Shiroma: Well, if you're continuing on, shall we go together?

Shiroma: Honestly, I'm a little scared, too."

Shiroma: "Okay, let's go then."

Shiroma: "What's wrong? You've never seen a stove before?

Shiroma: You can combine, by putting 2 claws or saddles in there and adding Fire or Thunder.

Shiroma: Combining may get you more powerful claws and saddles. Why don't you try it?

Shiroma: "I don't have to tell you? You know already?"

Shiroma: "Then I guess I'll just tag along with he wise [player name]."

===Using the Teleport Tag for the first time===
Shiroma: "Huh? Why did I come back here with you?"

Shiroma: "Oh well, let's go."

===10F (Mysterious Dungeon)===
Shiroma: This place is... kinda creepy."

Shiroma: "Wh, what?"

====After defeating Skullhammer====
Shiroma: "We must hurry..."

====Outside the Crystal Room====

Shiroma: "No, you can't go in.

Shiroma: Who knows what will happen to you if you go in there...?"

Mog: "Hey, it sounds like you plan to snatch my treasure.

Mog: Why else would you be here? Well, I'm not letting you."

Shiroma: "Well, you see......"

Mog: "Sounds fishy. That's why you can't trust humans.

Mog: By the way, all the treasure is gonna be mine."

Shiroma: "Wait!"

====When Mog enters the Crystal Room====
Shiroma: "I'm sorry I left you. It's for the best if you don't go any further..."

Shiroma: "I'm human... so I'll be fine."

Shiroma: "But the one who already went in there..."

Shiroma: "What, he's your friend?"

Mog: "Th, this is the dungeon's treasure...?"

Mog: "Ha, hahahaha heehee hee.

Mog: It was definitely worth coming this far!!

Mog: This will be the rarest in my collection of rare items...

Mog: Huh? Just who are you and where'd you sneak in from?

Mog: But anyway, that's mine, so get your dirty little hands off it! Scram!"

Mog: "If you don't, I'll..."

Mog: "Humph. Let that Guz play with the Recycle Boxes."

Mog: "Let's see... How am I gonna get this treasure..."

Mog: "Here I go.

Mog: I can't reach..."

Mog: "Once more..."

Mog: Huh? What's going on!?"

Mog: "Wahhh!!"

Shiroma: Wh, what!?"

==Monster Village==

===Beach===
[Hey, you okay?]

Shiroma: "Oh, I see.

Shiroma: Perhaps the entire dungeon fell in the ocean and we ended up here..."

Shiroma: "What's wrong?"

Shiroma: Oh...

Shiroma: Are... you okay?"

Mog: "Y, yeah...

Mog: Where am I...? I was just gonna grab that giant treasure...

Mog: Argh!! The dungeon collapsed and fell into the sea..."

Shiroma: "Of course, that means...my house is gone, too..."

Mog: "Shoot... That giant treasure..."

Shiroma: Well, since my house was destroyed,

Shiroma: all I can do is return to the village..."

Mog: "What, there's a village around here?"

Shiroma: "Yes, we're probably close to the village now..."

Mog: "Well, take me there!

Mog: I'm outta practice. It's been so long since I've explored a dungeon, I'm beat."

Shiroma: "O, okay... I guess that's all I can do..."

Mog: "Alright [player name], come on, move it."

===Inside the village===
Mog: "So, this is the village...?"

["Hmph, so you're back?]

Shiroma: "Hi... Auntie Bomb..."

Mog: "B, bomb!?"

Mrs. Bomb: "Hmph, you've got no right to call me auntie.

Mrs. Bomb: You're probably just up to no good again."

Shiroma: "That's not..."

Mog: "She's one of the bad guys?"

Mrs. Bomb: "What a peculiar visitor.

Mrs. Bomb: So, something bad must have happened to you?"

Mog: "You got that right!"

Shiroma: "What?"

Mrs. Bomb: "I see. Well, you just can't trust humans.

Mrs. Bomb: So, you must be on a journey. If so, you can stay at my house.

Mrs. Bomb: I wouldn't want you to stay at a human's house by mistake."

Mog: "You're pretty nice!

Mog: Especially for someone with such a scary face."

Mrs. Bomb: "I could've done without the face comment, sonny. Come with me."

Mog: "Well, come on [player name]."

Bomb Kid: "Freak!"

Bomb Kid: "W-e-i-r-do!"

Bomb Kid: "......"

Shiroma: "I guess I'll go home. You'd better go too."

===Mrs. Bomb's home===
Bomb Kid: I wonder what today's dinner is gonna be?"

Mrs. Bomb: Bombay style wildrat curry."

Bomb Kid: "Yeah, yeah!"

Bomb Kid: You're friends with that human. Humans are bad, so you are too."

====Talking to Mog at Mrs. Bomb's home====
Mog: "Hey, [player name], we can stay here for a little while.

Mog: Anyway, it looks like there might be tons of rare items around here.

Mog: Maybe we can find a treasure like that big crystal, too.

Mog: Man, that crystal was huge. It's such a waste that it fell into the ocean...

Mog: If there was only some way to get it from the sea floor..."

Mrs. Bomb: "Are you still talking about that? You don't learn, do you...?

Mrs. Bomb: Let the humans deal with that rubbish. Only the weird old man that lives in tha ower would be

Mrs. Bomb: crazy enough to try and make something that takes you to the bottom of the ocean."

Mog: "What!!

Mog: That weird old guy has something that'll go to the sea floor?"

Mrs. Bomb: "Yes. He was talking about its submission or something..."

Mog: "A submarine!!

Mog: [player name], that's it!! We can get the sunken treasure!"

Mog: "Okay [player name], I'll get everything ready in the village.

Mog: Your job is to go find the old guy 'n ask to use his submarine."

Mog: "[player name], the ocean's great.

Mog: There're lottsa fish 'n tasty stuff."

Mog: "Great, now that it's decided I'm countin' on you."

Mog: "I'm countin' on you, [player name]."

====Talking to Mrs. Bomb====
Mrs. Bomb: "The old guy lives in a tower on the outskirts of the village,

Mrs. Bomb: but the gate to his tower is locked. No one wants to see that human.

Mrs. Bomb: It's probably best if you find another way."

Mrs. Bomb: "Oh, you're staying here, too? Well, I guess it's fine with me."

===Shiroma's home===

====First dialogue of Shiroma====
Shiroma: "Ah... How do you like the village?

Shiroma: "Oh, you were worried about me?

Shiroma: No, Mrs. Bomb is really a nice person.

Shiroma: But for some reason, that dungeon caused all the villagers to act funny and doubt humans.

Shiroma: But then again, the only humans around here are the old man living in the tower and me."

====Second dialogue of Shiroma====
Shiroma: "That old guy? He lives on the outskirts of the village...

Shiroma: But the gate leading to his tower is all locked up now...

Shiroma: I think Chubby Chocobo has the key..."

Shiroma: "Chubby Chocobo is my childhood friend. He's at the Tool Shop."

====Third dialogue of Shiroma====
Shiroma: "How do you like my room?

Shiroma: I felt a little uneasy living in the village, so I moved.

Shiroma: But now I'm back. I should add some decorations in here."

===Chubby Chocobo's shop===
Chubby Chocobo: "Oh no! A customer?

Chubby Chocobo: I'm sorry, I'm not open yet."

Chubby Chocobo: "What? Do I know anything about a gate key?

Chubby Chocobo: Yeah, I've got one. Everyone's freaked out by that old man so they locked the gate.

Chubby Chocobo: As for me, I have to do business with him so I use the key to go in and out."

Chubby Chocobo: "Huh? You wanna go see the old man?

Chubby Chocobo: Why didn't you tell me that sooner? I'll open it for you."

====After Chubby Chocobo opens the gate to the tower====
Chubby Chocobo: "<Huff> <Huff> It's open. It's a lot of work... this walking business."

Chubby Chocobo: "Huh? You would have opened it yourself if I gave you the key?

Chubby Chocobo: Tell me that kind of stuff sooner. I'm pooped."

Chubby Chocobo: "I don't wanna move anymore."

==Cid's Tower==

===3F (Cid's Tower)===
Grandpa: There!

Grandpa: Take that!

Grandpa: And that!

Grandpa: "Whew, geez, they just keep comin' & comin'."

Grandpa: "What's that!?"

Grandpa: "Hey pardner, ya say you're not an enemy, huh?

Grandpa: "But that trick won't fool me!

Grandpa: "Well then, just what are ya doin' in my tower?"

Grandpa: "Ya forgot? Geez, well ya've got a selective memory.

Grandpa: I don't have time to deal with a fella like you. I've gotta get my tower back from the Imps.

Grandpa: What a disaster! The Imps have taken over my precious machine..."

Grandpa: "You say ya'll help me?"

Grandpa: "In exchange for a favor, huh?"

Grandpa: "Well, what's the favor?"

Grandpa: "Of course. Ya fergot, huh?"

Grandpa: "Oh well. Look's like ya're not the type that can cause mischief.

Grandpa: Besides, as long as I'm following behind ya, there'll be no danger.

Grandpa: Do you even remember yer own name?"

Grandpa: "Nice to meet ya, [player name]. I'm..."

Cid: "I'm [Cid name]. The genius scientist, [Cid name].

====10F (Cid's Tower)====
Cid: "Finally, we're almost there."

Cid: "But why're there so many of those Imp varmints?"

Cid: "Oh yeah, there's no reason ya'd know that..."

["They're about to wake."]

Cid: "So who are ya?"

Bahamut: "I? I am Bahamut, the keeper of time.

Bahamut: Having found the existence and power which should not exist in this place and time,

Bahamut: I have come."

Cid: "What are ya ramblin' about? The Imps are sayin' what?"

Bahamut: "They aren't the source, but merely its servant.

Bahamut: But it is certain they are trying to make that power complete.

Bahamut: Beware. I have yet to find out the truth of this matter,

Bahamut: The power, the Imps, and the meaning of the girl's existence."

Cid: "...just who was that fella?"

===14F (Cid's Tower)===
Cid: "Who the heck built this big tower...?

Cid: "Huh!? No doubtin' that's...!"

Cid: "My machine, it's safe!

Cid: I didn't think they'd get it this far.

Cid: "This is my machine, I call her...

Cid: I call her [Cidtank name]!! With [Cidtank name], we're invincible!!!"

Cid: "All aboard!!"

===15F (Cid's Tower)===
Cid: "Ya varmints!! Taking over a man's house...!!"

Imp: "Kyahahaha. This tower will be ours.

Imp: And we shall prepare for his revival."

====After defeating the Imps====
Cid: "Yeehaw, I finally got my tower back.

Cid: Yep, and it's all thanks to yer help. I'll do ya that favor now."

Cid: "Ya forgot again? I guess ya've had too many Amnesia Tonics."

Cid: "What?

Cid: Ya want me to take ya back to the village so ya might remember?

Cid: Jeez, what a pushy fella! Guess I can't say no, though.

Cid: If I go, the village folk will all be scared, though.

Cid: Well, shall we get a move on?"

Cid: "Let's get a move on then."

===Back to the village===
[Huh...?]

Shiroma: "You're back. And you brought [Cid name], too."

Cid: "Howdy, little lady. Ya look well."

Shiroma: "I'm doing alright.

Shiroma: Oh yes. I heard he went to ask you to borrow your submarine.

Shiroma: Can I get a ride, too?

Shiroma: I'm still concerned about that dungeon..."

Cid: "I see. That was what ya were supposed to ask me.

Cid: Sounds great! It's been a long time since I brought out the Cidmarine!!"

==Sea Floor Dungeon==
[Finally reached the dungeon entrance!]

Shiroma: "Hee hee hee...

Shiroma: Something good happened?

Shiroma: "How did I get here, you ask?"

Shiroma: "You say you swam and swam until you found the dungeon's entrance?"

Shiroma: "Hee hee. You wonder how I made it here when you had to swim so far?"

Shiroma: "Well let me explain."

Shiroma: "How do you like the bridge made by [Cid name]'s submarine?

Shiroma: In a rush, we grabbed on to the submarine's arm and then that's what happened...

Shiroma: We didn't even need that big thing after all. You made such a big deal about it, too."

Shiroma: "Well, let's go then."

Shiroma: "To the dungeon, of course.

Shiroma: I'm going to solve the secret to that dungeon no matter what."

Shiroma: "Well, let's be careful."

===15F (Sea Floor Dungeon)===
Shiroma: "What's this...? The dungeon's...stove? No, that's not it..."

Bahamut: "I don't sense any movement yet..."

Bahamut: "However...you are a mysterious organism."

Bahamut: "Meeting you here again must be...?"

Bahamut: "I see... you are the girl..."

Shiroma: "Who are you?"

Bahamut: "I? I am the keeper of time, Bahamut.

Bahamut: Young lady, you must turn back."

Shiroma: "What are you talking about?"

Bahamut: "This place and he... do not belong in this time.

Bahamut: It's best just to live in the village without knowing. The villagers' doubts will pass.

Bahamut: As long as they do not awaken..."

Shiroma: "What do you know about this?"

Bahamut: I know nothing. I am only looking after time..."

Shiroma: "......"

===Cutscene with Bahamut and Shiroma on an unnamed realm===
Shiroma: "You... What on earth are you doing here?"

Bahamut: "You dare come here after all.

Bahamut: Do you plan to find what this realm is?"

Shiroma: "Of course that's what I plan to do."

Bahamut: "I see... I am the keeper of time...

Bahamut: I have come to investigate the land that should not exist in this time.

Bahamut: Now I know. This land, this dungeon, is from the distant future."

Shiroma: "The future?"

Bahamut: "Yes... The distant future.

Bahamut: There, humans like you have built an advanced civilization.

Bahamut: This dungeon was built by them as a weapon."

Shiroma: "A weapon? Why would they...?"

Bahamut: "They were fighting against him...

Bahamut: The truth is here."

====Flashback with the Imps====
Bahamut: "They were defeated in their fate to leave the world.

Bahamut: However, as a way to revive the dead, they built this weapon.

Bahamut: Their lust for technology pushed them,

Bahamut: to the point where they could build a time-traveling device such as this.

Bahamut: But this dungeon, too, was overrun by the Imps.

Bahamut: That must have been the downfall of their civilization...

Bahamut: The humans were defeated in their last bastion and prepared for the worst.

Bahamut: And then, he, himself came and their worst fears became a reality..."

====Back to the unnamed realm with Bahamut and Shiroma====
Bahamut: "One man tried to save a single life.

Bahamut: That man was one of the creators of this weapon.

Bahamut: That man planned to dimensionally transport his newborn child...

Bahamut: To a time where there was no war...

Bahamut: However, that wish was prevented by the sudden appearance of him.

Bahamut: The dimensional transfer was disturbed by him and it failed. Then the unthinkable happened.

Bahamut: This weapon, him, the Imps and even that child were brought to this time..."

Bahamut: So young lady, do you understand? That girl is you.

Bahamut: They were put to sleep in this dungeon and you were raised by the villagers."

Shiroma: "......"

Bahamut: "I can't tell you to turn back. That is your decision."

Shiroma: "......Let's go."

===25F (Sea Floor Dungeon)===
Shiroma: "We must hurry..."

Shiroma: "Aaghh!!"

Shiroma: "I'm okay..."

====Underwater ocean====
Shiroma: "So... it's okay, don't worry about it."

Shiroma: "Oh... the beautiful...ocean... it looks... like snow..."

Shiroma: "Ah! Ouch..."

Shiroma: "I'm okay, I'm okay..."

Shiroma: "...Can I ask a strange question?'

Shiroma: "Why do you travel with [Mog name]?"

Shiroma: "Do you, like him?"

Shiroma: "Why?"

Shiroma: "So you don't know either...

Shiroma: Of course... I knew I was...adopted...

Shiroma: I kind of sensed I was different. Not because I'm human... but something else.

Shiroma: But, Mrs. Bomb, the Head Magician, Ben, Chubby Chocobo, [Cid name],

Shiroma: they've always been nice to me, from the time I could remember.

Shiroma: I've lived in the village ever since...

Shiroma: So that's why...no... I'm not making it an excuse but...

Shiroma: I'm just fond of everyone in the village.

Shiroma: So even if things are unfriendly now, I know things will go back the way they were.

Shiroma: Isn't it the same with you and [Mog name]?"

Shiroma: "To have the feeling of wanting to care for someone. It's simple, that's all.

Shiroma: I don't mean that it's insignificant. Just...you don't need a reason.

Shiroma: So it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter when or where I was born.

Shiroma: It doesn't even matter what I may be.

Shiroma: ...They say I'm from the future... but I don't know..."

===27F (Sea Floor Dungeon)===
Ultros: Ge-hahahahah...

Shiroma: "Did you say something?"

Shiroma: "Oh, nevermind..."

Ultros: A girl, a girl, girl... It was worth waiting after all...

Ultros: And there's a tasty looking bird. Today is definitely my lucky day.

Ultros: I, the Great Ultros, haven't had this kind of dinner in quite a while...

Ultros: I, will slobber all over you!

Shiroma: "What!?"

====After defeating Ultros====
Ultros: "Awww, c'mon... How cruel..."

Shiroma: "...... What an odd monster."

====At the entrance of the Crystal Room====
Shiroma: "This is..."

Shiroma: "This is the dungeon we were at before...

Shiroma: It collapsed, what's it doing here?

Shiroma: And it looks like everything is new again... like it's alive..."

Shiroma: "...It won't open."

Shiroma: "Maybe there's a trigger that'll open the door..."

Shiroma: "Wha, what?"

Imp: "Kyahahahaha!!"

[Can't open the doors.]

====Cutscene with Glass Goth Z at the Crystal Room====
Imp: "Kyahahahaha Glass Goth, we got her, Sir."

Glass Goth: "Guh...gah... t, take her away..."

Imp: "Kyahahahaha Yes sir."

Glass Goth: "I, will destroy, everything... This, world, this, time..."

====Returning to Mrs. Bomb's home====
Mog: "So you're back. How was it? Where's the treasure?"

Mog: "...What's up [player name]?"

Cid: "Ya don't think the little lady was taken?"

Mog: "Who are you, man?"

Cid: "Let's just forget about that fer now pardner.

Cid: That Bahamut fella came to see me...

Cid: Says the monster he was talking about was the one that kidnapped the little lady.

Cid: But...if he had time to come tell me, he should have helped.

Cid: He even had time to point me in the right direction: Snow Mountain.

Cid: It's up ahead in the cavern."

Mrs. Bomb: "Hah! Serves her right. She deserved it."

Cid: "Mrs. Bomb, ya still talkin' like that?

Cid: Of all people, you should know that little lady isn't like that."

Mrs. Bomb: "Just what are you trying to say?"

Cid: "Nevermind ma'am.

Cid: So [player name], yer goin' too, right little fella?"

Cid: "It's gonna be a hard trip through the forest and mountains.

Cid: Ya still wanna go?"

Cid: "I'll wait over yonder, outside the village near the forest entrance."

Mog: "No, if ya say you wanna go, I can't stop you, but..."

==Snow Mountain==

===Crystal blocking the path===
Cid: "What's this? We can't go on with this!"

Cid: "Eyah!!"

Cid: "Uhyah!!"

Cid: "It's no use. It won't budge."

[That's the problem with you humans. Pathetic.]

Cid: "Just who are you!?"

Mrs. Bomb: "You can't do anything by yourself, can you?"

Cid: "Whatcha doing here?

Cid: This' no place for someone like ya to be. It's dangerous just getting here..."

Mrs. Bomb: "Hah! Don't make me laugh.

Mrs. Bomb: You think I'd lose to a bunch of sad monsters in that dungeon?

Mrs. Bomb: They all chicken out when I act like I'm going to self-destruct. It's all too easy."

Cid: "But why all the way here...?"

Mrs. Bomb: "Stand back......"

Cid: "Wha?"

Mrs. Bomb: "I'm telling you to stand back! Are you deaf!?"

Mrs. Bomb: "I hate to say this, but you were right. I can't go beyond this point.

Mrs. Bomb: I gave it everything just to get here. I'm just not cut out for the cold. I'm a fool.

Mrs. Bomb: But... that child is more of a fool.

Mrs. Bomb: It doesn't matter what the rest of the villagers think.

Mrs. Bomb: She's just a stranger, right? I just decided to care for the human child on a whim.

Mrs. Bomb: But she tries to keep her smile. Even though she's miserable, she hides it.

Mrs. Bomb: I don't know, I just don't know why, but looking at her like that made me even more mad.

Mrs. Bomb: I don't want to blame that dungeon. I don't want to believe that I am such a weak woman.

Mrs. Bomb: Except...I sense it, I can feel there is something ahead of here.

Mrs. Bomb: An entity so much in pain, so vengeful that it makes you feel wretched...

Mrs. Bomb: If I can feel that, then I'm no different than those trapped monsters after all.

Mrs. Bomb: And I can't leave that child in that place.

Mrs. Bomb: I won't be able to see her miserable smile again. I can't have that."

Cid: "Well I'll be..."

Mrs. Bomb: "You're [player name], right? You'll be okay.

Mrs. Bomb: Even if you go on further, you won't get taken in by the dungeon. You're the same as her.

Mrs. Bomb: You know the true meaning of caring for others.

[Please... take care of her...for me."]

====After Mrs. Bomb detonates====
Cid: "......"

Mrs. Bomb 1: "What's that look for!?"

Mrs. Bomb 2: "D, did you all think I was going to die or something?"

Mrs. Bomb 1: "Give me a break. If I die who's going to take care of the kids?

Mrs. Bomb 1: I just used the age-old family-technique of 'divide and self donate'!"

Mrs. Bomb 2: "A, anyway, hurry it up!!"

Mrs. Bomb 1: "Good luck..."

===23F (Snow Mountain)===
Glass Goth: "You, brought it... Bring it, closer..."

Cid: "Whatcha saying!? Just give back the little lady!!"

Glass Goth: "With this, I will be able to destroy, everything!

Glass Goth: Destruction, devastation, desolation..."

====After defeating Glass Goth====
Glass Goth: "It's, not over, yet......"

Cid: "Now, let's go find the little lady..."

Cid: "Let's move on."

====Meeting with Bahamut====
Cid: "Bahamut, you again!"

Bahamut: "He... is headed for the sea floor dungeon.

Bahamut: He plans to activate that dungeon.

Bahamut: The key was supposed to be the only way to awaken that dungeon...

Bahamut: Either the time has come or his sheer hatred is what is causing it to start..."

Cid: "...Bahamut...

Cid: Who do ya think ya are...?

Cid: The Keeper of Time? That's fine. But I'm only here to help the little lady.

Cid: Awaken? I don't care about that now.

Cid: Why does all this have to happen to the little lady?"

Bahamut: "...... Would the young lady want that?"

Cid: "Whatcha talkin' about?"

Bahamut: "The same key should start the dungeon and return it

Bahamut: to it's proper time. That key lies with the girl and her pendant,

Bahamut: the pendant entrusted to her from the future.

Bahamut: Yes, the one [player name] has..."

Cid: "Whatcha talking about?"

Bahamut: "I believe the girl has the ability to return those to the forsaken future.

Bahamut: The dungeon, Glass Goth, and..."

Cid: "Aw shucks, don't tell me ya'll return the little lady

Cid: and the dungeon to the future...

Cid: What's she supposed to do in the dying future?"

Bahamut: "That is for the young lady to decide. All I can do is observe..."

Cid: "!!! [player name]!! Are ya listening?"

Cid: "It's no use.

Cid: He ain't listening. Even if he was, he wouldn't know anyway..."

Cid: "Hey! Yo! [player name]! Wait up!!"

===At Shiroma's home===
Chubby Chocobo: "Gramps...I heard [Shiroma name] returned to the future..."

Cid: "Chubby Chocobo, howdy."

Chubby Chocobo: "How can that be... we've been inseparable till now..."

Cid: "It can't be helped. It's what the little lady decided."

Cid: "Anyway...what about that fella? He's been like that ever since..."

Chubby Chocobo: "......"

Cid: "What the heck!?"

====After the cutscene====
Cid: "Well I'll be. That's the dungeon that sank to the sea bottom!?"

Cid: "Ya mean ya dived down there and saw it with yer own eyes!?"

Cid: "Then... The little lady must be in there!?

Cid: She must be there, along with that fella ya say?"

Cid: "It must be like ya say!

Cid: If that's true, we must go and help her!

Cid: But the problem is that dungeon is in the air...

Cid: How're we gonna drag that sucker down here?

Cid: The only thing we can do is to use Cidwind.

Cid: Chubby Chocobo, please go tell all the villagers our plan.

Cid: I'm sure there is no one who would abandon her after she

Cid: sacrificed herself to help us."

Chubby Chocobo: "Okay!! I'm off!"

Cid: "Awright, I'll wait at the tower.

Cid: Come on over once ya finish yer gettin' ready."

==Cid's Tower (2nd visit)==

===1F (Cid's Tower, 2nd visit)===
Cid: "Howdy [player name]. My tower's been taken over again.

Cid: With the appearance of that dungeon, those varmints are gettin' uppity.

Cid: Cidwind is at the top of the tower. Can't carry out our plan if we can't get there."

Cid: Move it out [player name]!

===10F (Cid's Tower, 2nd visit)===
Cid: "...Bahamut, it's you again.

Cid: Ya no longer surprise me with yer random appearances. I'd like to ask ya one thing.

Cid: What is it that ya want? Things ain't goin' yer way so ya've come to me to gripe?"

Bahamut: "The villagers' hearts are starting to open up...towards the girl.

Bahamut: They're opening up towards her after all,

Bahamut: even though the the dungeon is becoming more powerful."

Cid: "Well, her faith in the villagers wasn't wasted after all."

Bahamut: "Her faith...? [Cid name], I have a favor to ask of you."

Cid: "What is it?"

Bahamut: "Command me to give you power."

Cid: "What?"

Bahamut: "Please... I want to observe this era a little longer."

Cid: "Awright.

Cid: Bahamut. Lend us yer power. We cannot go on without yer power."

Bahamut: "That sounds good.

Bahamut: For only now your voice sounds like the voice of time."

Cid: "Hmmm, the fella can be a pain in the behind..."

===14F (Cid's Tower, 2nd visit)===
Cid: "I'm fighting with the likes of ya again...? I won't lose!!"

===15F (Cid's Tower, 2nd visit)===
Cid: "These fellas sure are persistent!"

Imp: "Kahahaha, the time for restoration has come!"

====After defeating the Imps again====
Cid: "Remember, follow the plan. Everyone ready?"

Cid: "Awright then, let's mosey."

====Launching the plan====
Cid: "Awright, let's mosey."

Cid: "This's [Cid name], How's it looking over here, Chubby Chocobo?"

Chubby Chocobo: "It's all ready. The Head Magician's here too."

Head Magician: "Greetings, Cid

Head Magician: Who would have thought the day would come for us to combine our powers?

Head Magician: Are you still pursuing your odd studies?"

Cid: "Coming from ya, I'll take that as a compliment."

Cid: Gotton and Gauche both came too?"

Gotton: "Gotton, protect, village. Same as, protect, tree."

Cid: "Well then, y'all git to yer posts."

Gotton: "Gotton, understand, okay, okay."

Cid: "Then......

Cid: "We're shoving off, too, [player name]."

====After the destruction====
Mog: "You're back, [player name]."

Cid: "Whatcha in such a hurry 'bout pardner?"

Mog: "I was thinkin' I should go to that dungeon too..."

Cid: "I bet yer looking for treasure.

Cid: That's no good, we gotta help the little lady."

Mog: "I'll help you look for her.

Mog: Besides, aren't we partners? I can't just let [player name] do all the work."

Cid: "Are you saying ya'll go along too?

Cid: Oh well, looks like I'm making the plan with Bahamut."

Mog: "Yeah, that's good. I'll wait ahead at the forest.

Mog: Sorry 'bout always making you guys go first."

==Final Dungeon==

===Cutscene with Bahamut and Mog on an unnamed realm===
Mog: "Uh, hey! I've heard about you. You're that Bahamut guy."

Bahamut: "......"

Mog: "What's with you? The silent treatment?

Mog: You're silent and trying to act all cool now, but I've heard about you. You talk a lot."

Bahamut: "......"

Mog: "?? What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?"

Bahamut: "I have times when I am without words...

Bahamut: One of those times happens to be now."

Mog: "......?

Mog: [player name], you know what he's talking about?"

Bahamut: "He, Glass Goth, was the demon that annihilated the future civilization.

Bahamut: I knew that... However, I do not know how or why he existed in the future."

Mog: "You saying that monster in there came from the future?

Mog: Don't worry about him. [player name] will kick his butt."

Bahamut: "So simple...minded...

Bahamut: Glass Goth is not from the future. He is returning here.

Bahamut: It all began here. You should see it.

Bahamut: No, you must see it. The reason for that lies here,

Bahamut: Beyond this screen that displays time..."

====Flashback with Mog at the Crystal Room====
Mog: "Hey! That's me!

Mog: Wasn't this the giant crystal room from the submerged dungeon?

Mog: Yeah, that was when I chased off that stupid Guz and...

Mog: I was walking along and thinking about how to get the treasure and...

Mog: When I made a grab for the crystal, everything around it started...

Mog: Then I frantically tried to rush outside... And then after that..."

Bahamut: "Yes, everything began with that..."

Guz: "......M, me? Are you talking to me?

Guz: M, my wish? The thing I want most? Are you givin' me something?

Guz: ......I, w, want, power.

Guz: Power... then no one can pick on me. Power... then no one can make fun of me.

Guz: If I had power, If I had power, Power...power..."

Bahamut: "That started it all.

Bahamut: The weak creature called a Guz was given power by the crystal and started evolving."

Mog: "E, evolving?"

Bahamut: "It was an evolution.

Bahamut: An evolution that took longer than you or I could endure.

Bahamut: An eternity passed and when human civilization arrived, the Guz was the powerful Glass Goth..."

====Back to the unnamed realm with Bahamut and Mog====
Mog: "N, no..."

Bahamut: "This is the truth.

Bahamut: The beginning of everything started here, on this land, in this time.

Bahamut: The dungeon taking all the monsters, the attitude alteration of the villagers,

Bahamut: it all comes from him- his hatred of those who tormented him, his enormous vengeance,

Bahamut: and his desire for great power...

Bahamut: Those strong feelings shifted the space-time continuum and summoned this dungeon from a far

Bahamut: off dimension to take shape here.

Bahamut: It appears his vengeance, his hatred, was more powerful than the girl's determination."

Mog: "I hope you're not blaming me for all this!?

Mog: It's not my fault! It's just his own personal unfair grudge, against all of us!"

Bahamut: "You are an intuitive creature, [Mog name].

Bahamut: You've probably been sensing it without noticing it.

Bahamut: You didn't come to this dungeon because you wanted treasure, did you...?

Bahamut: I'm sure part of it was because you didn't want to be alone.

Bahamut: You didn't want to be away from [player name] either..."

Mog: "Uh..."

Bahamut: "I have spoken the truth."

Mog: "......

Mog: Wh, what is he talking about, eh, [player name]?

Mog: The great [Mog name] isn't the type to take that guy's unfair grudge seriously.

Mog: More than that, it's the treasure... Yeah...treasure..."

===26F (Final Dungeon)===
Mog: "Oh no! What's this!?"

Glass Goth: "I, I have, I have, power...! Power power...!"

====After defeating Glass Goth Z====
Glass Goth Z: "Ga, gahahahahaha gahahahahahahahahaha"

Mog: "Whew, I guess it's defeated..."

Mog: "Huh? Whazzat?"

Mog: "Hey, [player name]!!"

Mog: "This looks bad..."

===At the Crystal Room===
Shiroma: "What are you doing here?"

Shiroma: "What? Just get aboard and you'll tell me later?"

====Chocobo and Mog at Shiroma's home====
Cid: "Ey! Hurry up and wake up."

Cid: "I wanna say y'all did great but, how about the little lady?"

Mog: "We couldn't find her..."

Cid: "Is that so...?"

Cid: "What, that's not what ya mean?"

Cid: "Ya met up with the little lady but got separated?

Cid: But she should still be safe?"

Cid: "That so... By the way, I found a peculiar lil' fella.

Cid: He seemed so pitiful I brought him along..."

Mog: "Huh? Th, that guy!?"

Mog: "He turned into the Glass thingy guy!

Mog: Because he took our help the wrong way, it's come to this!?"

Cid: "Whaddya mean?"

Cid: Whatcha talkin' about?

====Chip====
Chip: "Hello everyone. I'm everyone's idol, Chip.

Chip: I'm sure you've all met me before, but if not, please find me.

Chip: Well this is the end for Chocobo's Dungeon. Did you have fun?

Chip: But for those who still wanna adventure with Chocobo and Shiroma,

Chip: we have a special bonus mode for you.

Chip: Look forward to what happens.

Chip: I hope you enjoy it.

Chip: Oh yes yes...

Chip: Please give the reborn guy a new name.

Chip: [Kuz name]? What a great name.

Chip: Take your time and have fun."

====Back to Shiroma's home====
Shiroma: "It's been awhile. You must be back to do some more adventuring.

Shiroma: This time around, I can even explore a dungeon by myself.

Shiroma: The dungeons you've explored are back again and there's even a secret dungeon.

Shiroma: You might even find an extra ending... There seems to be a lot to do. Have a look around."

Shiroma: "So what do you want to know about?"

Shiroma: "Well then... Be careful and good luck."

==Secret Dungeon==

===30F (Secret Dungeon)===
Leviathan: Why, why me...?

Leviathan: Why am I a boss?......

Leviathan: You don't want me along that badly......?

Leviathan: Yeah, I know I can't walk. I can only be in the water.

Leviathan: But, I've, I've worked so hard for you all this time..."

Leviathan: "You're so ungrateful!"

====After defeating Leviathan====
Leviathan: "Why, why, why me...?

Baby Mo: "But, I kinda wish mom'd come home too, y'know..."

====Going back to Ben's house====
Baby Mo: "I'm tryin' to clean up 'round here, but nothin' happens..."

Ben: "I'm tryin' to clean, but nothing happens! No progress at all...

Ben: Isn't there something that'd just clean this whole place up in one fell swoop?"

Ben: Okay! Let's clean this place up!"

====Barbara====
Baby Mo: Mommy!! Mommy!!"

Barbara: "I'm sorry, darling...

Barbara: There was something wrong with me..."

Ben: "Oh, don't worry. It's all in the past now. Let bygones be bygones.

Ben: I won't be able to quit being a sculptor, though, I'll carve you all something great."

Ben: "Oh, sorry to have to put you through all the trouble..."

Barbara: "No, it's alright.

Barbara: I left without even thinking about your job and everything..."

====Coming back once again to Ben's house====
Baby Mo: "It's nice that it's clean and all, but it's kinda lonely now.

Baby Mo: Daddy's gone out again...

Baby Mo: But that's okay, cuz' Daddy's the bestest sculptor in the whole world!"

Barbara: I want to make a nice dinner for our child..."

====At Asura's statue====
Ben: "I can't believe this came out without my knowing...

Ben: As soon as I carved a titan, he appeared."

====After beating the game====
Ben: "Just you wait, I'll carve you out perfectly...

Ben: But I'll need something to kindle my inspiration...

Ben: Like a fabulous magic stone or something...

====Having a Bahamut Stone in the inventory====

Ben: I beg you to give it to me, if I had it, I could carve this guy out!!"

====Giving a Bahamut Stone to Ben====
Ben: "Ho ho, thank you. I owe you one.

Ben: Okay, better get workin'..."

Ben: "Hmm, interesting..."

====Returning to Ben====
Asura: I have retuuuuurned!!

Asura: I have retuuurned! I knew my choice in coming here was correct.

Asura: And you must be the talented sculptor whom Titan was talking about."

Ben: "Uh, ya, I'm the one who carved Titan out, but..."

Asura: "I thank you.

Asura: I'd forgotten my true form,

Asura: so I just turned into a stone to wait for someone to come along and carve me out.

Asura: I'm so glad you carved me out."

Ben: "??? I don't get what you're talking about...

Ben: Besides, I'm not in that mood right now...

Ben: If you wanna return the favor, thank him. Same as with Titan, it's 'cus of him I created you."

Asura: "Understood. I'll lend a hand to this yellow guy over here!"

Asura: So it is!

[Received Asura.]

Asura: You're going to be surprised when you see the real me!!

Asura: Well, bye-bye to you, too!

Ben: "How in tarnation did it come out like that...?

Ben: I thought I was carving something more magnificent...

Ben: Three faces and six arms, and all the power born of those things..."

Ben: Aw, geez. It's just best to go home when you're down."

====Returning to Ben's house for the final time====
Baby Mo: "Daddy made another great one!"

Ben: "It's good to be able to forget about work when I'm home."

Barbara: "He talks so much about you now.

Barbara: He used to keep everything to himself."

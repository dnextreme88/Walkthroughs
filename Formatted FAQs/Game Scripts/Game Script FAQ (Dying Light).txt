==Story Quests==

These dialogues are from the main story quests. Dialogues in parenthesis are mentioned by the characters but don't appear on the screen.

===Awakening===

GRE: Hud activated. Commence briefing.

Pilot: Approaching Harran.

GRE: Data on the subject. Kadir Suleiman. A local political figure hired to maintain order after the outbreak. His brother Hassan died in a disease-related incident before we were able to evacuate him.

GRE: Suleiman blamed the GRE for Hassan's death. He stole a highly sensitive file which became his bargaining chip against the GRE.

GRE: With instructions to publicize it if anything happened to him.

GRE: Data on the subject. The stolen file. It details the incomplete process of synthesizing a cure for the virus. If implemented in its current state, the produced substance may be extremely toxic.

Pilot: Jump in ten seconds.

Pilot: Now!

GRE: Also, the file contains a full description of the virion structure. Any attempt to use it would result in countless lives lost. It must be recovered.

GRE: Further information. Current status.

GRE: Suleiman sent the file to an associate unknown to us, with instructions to publicize it at his command at any time.

GRE: To counter that, we instituted a city-wide communication jam, preventing him from publicizing the file.

GRE: Your GRE-issued radio can overcome that jamming. It is your lifeline. Do not lose it.

GRE: Suleiman has since gone underground and begun using a different name. We have reason to believe he now leads one of the two main factions operating within the city.

GRE: You are to find Suleiman and locate the stolen file in order to save mankind from a disaster of unprecedented proportions.

====After Crane lands on the Slums====
Rais' soldier: I told you that wasn't a normal drop chute.

Tahir: Break his legs. Then take him to Rais.

Crane: Back up. All of you.

Tahir: Stop! Loud noises draw them!

Tahir: Fall back! FALL BACK!

Amir: Come on. We have to move.

Jade: Let's get him off the street.

Amir: GET THE DOOR OPEN!

Jade: Amir! NO!

Amir: Go! RUN!!

Jade: Tower, this is Jade. Get Sickbay ready. Got a guy with a bad head wound... and a bite on one arm.

Rahim: Oh, sh*t! Amir's hurt?

Jade: No. Amir is gone... But I'm bringing in someone who might still survive.

Rahim: One of us?

Jade: We'll see.

====Waking up on The Tower====
Girl: You pinch him.

Boy: You're scared.

Girl: I'm not scared.

Boy: Then pinch him.

Girl: He blinked!

Boy: What?

Girl: He blinked again!

Boy: What if he's a zombie?!

Girl: Aaaaaaa!

Boy: Zombie! Run!

Crane: Sh*t... my head...

Guard: You sleep for three days like a dead man, then scare children? Off to a great start, 31.

Crane: Where am I?

Guard: In paradise, can't you see?

Guard: Okay, enough joking around. Head to room 190. The boss'll brief you.

Crane: What do you mean, "31"?

Guard: Ask the boss!

Salma: 31. That's your number.

Jared: Amir died because of this guy?

Derek: Quiet...

Jared: Oh, f*ck quiet. Now HE'S gonna get Amir's Antizin.

Aman: And you are...?

Crane: Crane. Uh... 31.

Aman: Oh. Right. How's your head?

Crane: My head?

Aman: Got it. Listen up: until the boss says so, you are not on the list. So go talk to him ASAP, and let's get things moving. Now, if you'll excuse me.

Crane: Hey, I'm looking for... are you the boss?

Rahim: What, am I too young? You got a problem with my age?

Crane: No, I... you wanted to talk to me.

Rahim: That's better. Do you remember anything? Know where you are?

Crane: (Yeah, yeah.) I can see this is... some kind of shelter?

Rahim: We call it "The Tower". Brecken and his runners put it all together a couple of months ago, and we've been here ever since.

Rahim: Hunting air drops, scavenging... and rescuing people.

Crane: Yeah... I wanted to thank that girl...

Rahim: Good. Because if not for her, you'd already be chewing somebody's knee bone. Your Antizin was totally crushed, by the way.

Rahim: Only thing Jade could salvage was your radio.

Crane: Great... so can I get that back, please?

Rahim: Actually, I think I need it more than you do.

Crane: Believe me, pal, that's not the case.

Rahim: Fine. Take it.

Rahim: You know why runners put their lives in danger? For guys like you.

Rahim: So now you take the Antizin meant for someone else, and you won't even share your gear with us?

Rahim: I don't have time to deal with your bullsh*t.

Rahim: I've lost contact with one of our guys, thanks to the f*ck*d-up radios we're stuck with.

Rahim: Do something for me, would you? I don't want to see you or your precious radio anymore, so go be useful somewhere else.

Rahim: We don't tolerate lazy *ssholes here in the Tower.

Crane: Hey. Be fair. I'm not lazy, I'm just...

Crane: Hey, Boss...

Rahim: Save it. That lost guy I mentioned? He's only on the 13th floor, but he might as well be trapped in a mine cave-in. Come back later.

Rahim: And I'm not the boss. Too young, remember? I'm Rahim. Brecken's in charge here.

Crane: I'm not lazy... you little sh*t!

Timur: Where do you think you're going?

Crane: The 13th floor. I'm getting some stuff for Rahim.

Timur: 13... ? Sh*t. That's gonna be some dirty work. But we all gotta pull our weight around here, huh?

====13th floor====
Crane: Jesus... how many people died here... ?

Crane: Crane here.

GRE: Where were you? We've been waiting for your report. It's been over 70 hours.

Crane: Lost my radio for a while. Don't worry, my cover's intact. No contact with the Tower's leader yet. Unable to confirm identity. I'm taking steps to blend in.

GRE: Acknowledged. Time is of the essence, Crane. Remember that.

Crane: There's one more thing. I... got bitten. I've shown no symptoms, but the people here say I'm infected.

GRE: ...Then you'd better get your hands on some Antizin ASAP, hadn't you?

Survivor: Help! HELP! Somebody!

Crane: What the hell?

====Helping a survivor====
Crane: Jesus... You all right, man?

Mark: I cut my arm... getting away from him... Oh, God... you had to kill him, didn't you? God d*mn it...

Mark: That was... that was my brother... I came down to see him and...

Crane: Easy. Easy. It's all right now... I'll get help.

Crane: Rahim, this is Crane. I'm down here on 13. Listen, this guy of yours got f*ck*d up pretty bad getting away from a zombie.

Rahim: Oh sh*t... 31?! You went after Mark? Is it... is it safe down there?

Crane: It's safe enough now.

Rahim: Okay, don't move! I'm sending Lena downstairs.

Crane: Hold still. Lena will be here any minute.

Mark: Gauze... You gotta find some gauze... And alcohol.

Mark: Combine them... That'll stop the bleeding... Please... hurry!

Crane: Try to stay calm, OK? I'll be right back.

Crane: Okay, I think that's everything I'm going to find. Let's give this a shot.

Lena: Okay, who's hurt?

Crane: He's bleeding pretty bad.

Lena: Let me see him... Gauze and alcohol, huh? Pretty primitive, but it'll work.

Lena: Thanks for the help, I'll take care of him from here.

Timur: Well done, 31.

Rahim: Hey, 31! Not bad for a new guy. Perhaps I misjudged you.

Crane: Hey, I just want to help out and repay you guys for what you did for me.

Rahim: Well, good. Come find me and we'll talk about how you can do that.

====At Brecken's office====
Crane: All right-taken care of. Piece of cake. What else you got for me?

Rahim: Well... Let me think.

Jade: Rahim, you are just smart enough to be dangerous, you know that? Omar told me about your plans for the nest. Explosive charges? REALLY?

Rahim: What? Explosives? I never said that!

Jade: Oh, please. You can't tell a convincing lie to save your life.

Rahim: I know what I'm doing!

Jade: Yeah? You think you can't die?

Rahim: You're not my mom!

Jade: No. I'm not. Our mom's dead. So you might want to be a little nicer to me since I'm the only family you have left... especially now that Amir's gone.

Crane: You're Jade, right?

Jade: Right...

Crane: I just wanted to thank you for what you did for me... and tell you how sorry I am for your loss. I owe you and Amir my life.

Jade: Yeah, you do. You want to return the favor? Keep my dipsh*t brother from killing himself!

Jade: NO EXPLOSIVES, Rahim.

Rahim: So...

Crane: So. Was that enough? Do I get to talk to Brecken now?

Rahim: First, go change your clothes. I left some new ones in your room. You're in 194.

Crane: Something wrong with what I'm wearing?

Rahim: You need something that fits the job Brecken wants you to do. Call me when you've changed.

====After changing gears====
Crane: Okay, Rahim, I'm ready. Where do I find Brecken?

Rahim: Not so fast, 31. If you're gonna earn your keep, we have to find out if you've got the skills. So get your ass up to the gym.

Crane: Gym? What're you talking about?

Rahim: It's on the top floor... just a couple flights up.

====At the rooftop====
Crane: Rahim? I don't see you. Where are you?

Rahim: Close.

Rahim: You ought to feel right at home - a Crane on a crane!

Crane: Jesus, Mary and Joseph... I should be wearing a parachute for this...

Rahim: Welcome to our gym. First things first: you've got to learn how to run.

Crane: What do you mean, "learn how to run"?

Rahim: Just do what I say, all right? Now. Jump down to the very bottom.

Crane: Are you nuts? I'd kill myself!

Rahim: Don't be a wimp.

Crane: Come on! You can't be serious!

Rahim: Watch this.

(Rahim: Woohoo! Hoo!)

Rahim: Aaagh! AAAHH! My LEG!

Crane: Rahim! Jesus! Don't move, I'll get help!

Rahim: (Haha!) I was just f*ck*ng with you.

Crane: Son of a B*TCH.

Rahim: What, you can't take a joke? Come on! Get your ass down here!

Crane: Christ on a crutch...

Crane: Holy sh*t. Holy SH*T!

Rahim: It's a rush, isn't it? But don't blow your load just yet. There's more.

Rahim: To survive outside you gotta take advantage of the terrain. Most eaters suck at climbing, so the harder the terrain is, the better for you.

Rahim: I've got some typical situation set up for you. Let's see how you handle them.

Rahim: Sometimes it's better to crawl through the low, narrow passages. Eaters'll have a tough time following you.

Rahim: Try not to slow down once you start running. Outside, if you stop - you're probably dead.

Rahim: Not bad... for a noob!

Rahim: All right, get up on that scaffold. And don't fall, 'cause there sure as hell ain't no net.

Rahim: That's my favorite: cat grab and muscle-up. You won't survive outside for ten minutes if you can't do that.

Rahim: Good job!

Rahim: OK, time for the real test! Get back to the crane - make use of anything and everything while you run!

Rahim: Ok, that's enough. You've got some serious natural talent, man. Either that, or you've done this before. You done this before?

Crane: Hardly. Closest I ever came to this was running track in high school.

Rahim: Well then you're a f*ck*ng prodigy. Never seen anything like it.

(Crane: What's happening to me!? Sh*t! Sh*t!)

Rahim: Crane?

Rahim: Crane! Talk to me! What's going on?

Crane: Something... went wrong... Rahim, what just happened to me?

Rahim: Oh, sh*t... I bet you're having your first seizure, Just get back over here.

Crane: Rahim, what the f*ck was that?! Does this mean I'm... turning?

Rahim: Most likely no. At least not yet. Seizures remind you that you're infected. You better go see Dr. Zere, though. He'll check you out, probably give you a shot of Antizin.

Rahim: Before you head out to see Zere, talk to the quartermaster. He'll gear you up so you can go outside without getting your head bitten off.

====Quartermaster====
Quartermaster: Ohhh, you're the new scout? Rahim radioed me about you.

Crane: (Yeah.) That's me. Name's Crane.

Quartermaster: I'm not gonna bother learning your name till you've survived a few days. But here, this is for you.

Quartermaster: By the way... Word around the Tower is you're just another deadbeat in line for food or Antizin.

Quartermaster: By which I mean, the people here don't much like you. But don't blame them. It's easy to get paranoid when you're isolated...

Quartermaster: ...and since somebody's jamming communications to the outside, there's plenty of paranoia to go around.

Quartermaster: Whole d*mn city with nobody to call for help but ourselves.

Quartermaster: You bring me some supplies from the air drops though, and you'll see people change their tunes in a hurry. That sh*t's a game-changer.

Crane: Thanks. I'll bear that in mind. Is there anything else? I'm in a bit of a rush...

Quartermaster: Also, if you're looking to get more popular, you can try helping folks. Do a few favors, they might like you more.

Quartermaster: Might even find a woman, keep you warm at night. Hahahaha!

Guard: Going outside, huh?

Guard: Okay, new guy. Be careful out there. We've lost too many already.

Rahim: Okay, newb, we've got Dr. Zere set up in a semi trailer on a fenced-in playing court.

Rahim: When you leave the Tower, hang a left and head due south. You can't miss it.

Rahim: It's Crane, kid.

Rahim: All right, all right, CRANE, just keep moving. There's no time to take in the sights.

Rahim: And try not to make too much noise. Sound attracts those f*ck*rs.

====Dr. Zere====
Crane: Doctor? Hello? Anybody there?

Zere: Camden? Are you there? Camden! ... Dammit.

Crane: Uh... so, I'm supposed to get a vaccine...

Zere: What? No, no. Suppressant. It's called Antizin. Suppresses the symptoms. Here, sit.

Zere: Antizin postpones the inevitable. Best the GRE could do.

Crane: Inevitable? So... there's no cure?

Zere: It's a variation of rabies. There's no cure right now, but you see, I've been running tests on both Antizin and infected tissue.

Zere: A cure is... possible. Definitely possible.

Crane: No sh*t? You really think you can figure it out?

Zere: With Dr. Camden's help, yes, I think so. Uh. Now where did I put that injector... ?

Crane: Who's Dr. Camden?

Zere: A colleague. Trapped in Sector 0 - where the outbreak first... well, broke out. We've been collaborating via radio.

Zere: Though we would have made more progress if the connection were better.

Zere: Also if my earlier experiments had borne fruit. I tried injecting recombined versions of the virus into chunks of meat and leaving them around the city.

Zere: Hoping some of the infected would eat them, so I could observe and document the results...

Crane: But they didn't?

Zere: It bore no fruit. I'm ashamed that I wasted so much time on it. No reason to hold any Antizin in reserve now, in any case...

Zere: All right! I'm quite busy! So on your way, now!

Zere: What was I doing?

Crane: Rahim - Zere checked me out, and gave me another shot.

Rahim: Okay, great. That ought to hold you for a while. Which is good, 'cause I'm starting to get used to the idea of bossing you around.

Rahim: So! Time for a real trial! Go talk to Spike. You'll find him near Zere's truck. He's got your first real job for you.

===First Assignment===
Crane: Spike? I'm Crane.

Spike: Just what I need. More unskilled labor. All right, shut up and pay attention: there are two types of airdrops. One has food, first aid supplies, survival gear and such.

Spike: The other kind is filled with Antizin. The GRE sends in a one-way video feed that lets us know when they're on the way.

Spike: Look, the trouble is, the airdrops with Antizin keeps getting raided by Rais's thugs. And without Antizin we are basically screwed.

Spike: Rais and his boys only operate during the day, because going out after dark is a dandy way to get killed.

Spike: But the next two Antizin drops are coming down right at sunset tonight, and Brecken means to go after them. This may be our only chance to reach the airdrop.

Crane: What's my part here?

Spike: Well, as I said, going out at night is basically suicide... or it would be, if I hadn't been setting up safe zones and traps out there for weeks now. Which I have.

Spike: Brecken and his team will be okay tonight-so long as you get out there now and arm those traps. THAT'S your part.

Crane: All right, what are these traps, and how do I arm them?

Spike: You'll see. I'll be talking you through it. Just remember... without these traps, Brecken won't survive the night. And if he doesn't come back with Antizin, we are lost.

Spike: Before you head out there, grab some firecrackers. Made them myself. They make a fine distraction if you get in trouble.

Spike: OK, first - the car. Open the hood and connect the battery. That'll arm the trap.

Jade: Jade here. Is anyone outside right now? Urgent help needed.

Crane: Uhm... I'm outside. Working for Spike...

Jade: You're Crane, right? Listen... Our runners's trying to secure one of our safe houses for Brecken's mission.

Jade: He's in a courtyard by Vefa and Mirmar, surrounded by zombies. We gotta help him!

Crane: All right, I'm on it...

====Virals====
Crane: Okay Jade, I'm here... along with some Infected.

Jade: Watch yourself, Crane!

Crane: Oh, man... I think it's too late for this guy.

Jade: Sh*t. All right. Finish it. Just... don't let him suffer.

Crane: Okay. It's done. F*CK.

Jade: You had no choice. He wasn't human anymore. Now, hurry.

Jade: You still need to turn on the lights. That's the only way to make the place safe at night.

Crane: Ah, sh*t.

Jade: How's it coming? Got the lights on?

Crane: Um. Almost. Just give me a second.

Crane: Crane here.

GRE: Report.

Crane: Okay, I met this doctor. A scientist type. They've got him set up in a sort of research trailer, and he's working on a cure for the virus. His name is Zere.

Crane: Hello? Do you copy?

GRE: Affirmative. Secondary objective added. Maintain your cover, and secure all of his research. Acknowledge.

Crane: Your stolen file still takes top priority, though, right?

GRE: Affirmative. We find it unlikely that a single researcher working out of a "trailer" could produce any significant results. But if he does, we want to see it.

Crane: Jade? It's done.

Jade: Good. We'll need to prepare more places like that one.

Jade: We've got more spots picked out for future safe zones. Spike will mark them on your map later.

Jade: And... Crane? Thank you... Back to you, Spike!

Spike: Right now you need to get back to our main task and arm the next trap. There's another car close by.

Crane: Got it.

Crane: The infected're all over the street.

Spike: So what does that tell you? Keep off the street! Try to stay on the rooftops where they can't reach you.

Crane: They're all around the car, Spike.

Spike: You still have some firecrackers, don't you? Just throw some into the crowd. Those dead b*st*rds are easily distracted.

Crane: All done with the car, Spike.

Spike: Keep on like that and you might just make it. The next trap's close by.

Spike: And I shouldn't have to tell you, but: don't get caught out in the open!

Crane: Spike, these freaks are everywhere. If I need to use a trap, how do I activate it?

Spike: You can't. I told you, they're only for the night mission.

Crane: Sh*t. Okay.

Crane: Quite a contraption you got here.

Spike: Three times brighter than an ordinary street lamp. Gives the infected quite the sunburn.

Crane: Okay, lights are all set.

Spike: You're ready for the next one, then. Better hurry.

Rahim: Hey, Crane, guess what? I'm up on a balcony, and I got eyes on you from here. Looks like you're doing okay. For a newbie.

Crane: Gee, thanks.

Rahim: Just try and get back here in one piece, all right? I don't wanna have to train somebody to replace you.

====Turning on the last light trap====
Crane: F*ck. Spike, the whole godd*mn district went down. What the hell's going on?!

Spike: Ugh... not again... All right, listen. There's a power substation near you. Go check it out.

Spike: Hey-this blackout has really put us in a tight spot.

Spike: We're defenseless here, plus the safe zones and some of my traps are down, too.

Spike: We need to get the power up and running ASAP.

Crane: I'm going as fast as I can, Spike.

Crane: F*ck! What is this... ?!

Crane: All right, I've got the substation reset. But if the grid shorted out once, you know it could happen again, right?

Spike: You leave the electrical engineering to me, okay? Just get your ass to a safe zone. You're gonna have to spend the night there.

====At a safe zone====
Crane: Oh sh*t-

Crane: What the f*ck is that?

Crane: Hey-Doc? This is Kyle Crane.

Zere: Crane? What can I do for you?

Crane: I just saw this freaking weird zombie covered in big green blisters. It hauled ass as soon as it spotted me. Do you know anything about it?

Zere: Hmm. Not enough information, I'm afraid. But if you see another one, do let me know, will you?

Spike: Crane, you awake?

Crane: Spike? What's going on?

Spike: Something bad happened. We need to talk.

Crane: Okay, give me a sec.

====Spike====
Crane: Spike - what's up?

Spike: Crane, first of all... you did great out there!

Spike: From now on, if you need something, come see me. And to start with...

Spike: Here's a UV flashlight and a remote control. You run up on a volatile, give him a face full of UV-or lead him into a trap, which you (can) trigger with the remote. Got it?

Crane: Got it.

Spike: Perfect. Now for the bad news: despite your efforts, Brecken's mission failed.

Crane: Sh*t... is he okay?

Spike: He's alive. But you need to get back to the Tower. Jade called all the Scouts in, and that means you.

Crane: Okay. Wonder if I'll finally get to meet Brecken in person?

Crane: Crane here.

GRE: Report.

Crane: I'm about to have a meeting with the Tower's leader.

GRE: Acknowledged. Confirm his identity and contact us immediately.

====Brecken====
Timur: Good job out there, 31! ... I mean, Crane... right?

Jade: Crane.

Jade: Listen: Brecken and a team of runners went after an air drop last night.

Jade: He lost the rest of the team to biters, and then Rais's men ambushed him, beat him to a pulp, and stole the drop.

Jade: Now Brecken wants to go after the next drop himself, but we can't let him. And you've got to back me up. Ok?

Lena: For God's sake, you can't even walk straight! We need you alive, you idiot!

Jade: Okay, we're going in. Act confident.

Jade: Brecken. Lena.

Lena: Maybe you can get through to him!

Jade: Jade. Who's your friend?

Crane: Kyle Crane.

Jade: Look, Brecken, the last thing we need is for you to go back out there. We can figure out another way. Without jeopardizing you. Right, Crane?

Crane: I'll go. I'll do it.

Jade: Right! Yes! Crane will go. He'll be happy to.

Brecken: Jesus. No offense, friend, but you're as green as grass. You can't just-

Jade: Crane will manage. He'll start in the right spot. And Lena's right: you need to be here, taking care of the Tower.

Jade: Convincing them the world's not over yet.

Brecken: Ah, hell. Maybe... one more try before we go to Rais. Yeah... okay. Fine.

Brecken: Good luck... Crane.

Brecken: Jade. A moment?

(Jade: Sure.)

Jade: Head for the Cauldron. I'll be in touch shortly.

===Airdrop===
Crane: Crane here.

GRE: Report.

Crane: The Tower boss is named Brecken, and he's definitely not your man.

Crane: The other likely suspect is this... warlord, basically. Local guy, calls himself Rais.

Crane: He's hoarding Antizin and then gouging the hell out of anybody who wants to buy some.

Crane: I'm on a mission to get Antizin from the air drop. If I don't succeed, they'll have to come up with something else.

GRE: Acknowledged. Good job, Crane. You're doing well. Stay on task and we'll be in touch.

GRE: Be sure to call us immediately if and when you get that Antizin.

Jade: Crane. Three-quarters of all airdrops fall in the Cauldron.

Jade: So if you start from there, you'll have the best chance of getting to that drop before Rais's men do.

Crane: On my way.

Crane: Jade, I'm getting close to the drop zone.

Jade: Good. Find some shelter and wait. Most of the drops seem to fall exactly in that area.

Crane: And there's a crate. It looks intact. I'll check out what's inside...

Crane: Dammit. Nothing here.

Jade: Did you see that?

Crane: Yeah, two drops.

Jade: They landed elsewhere unfortunately, but you're not that far away. Get to those crates before anyone else does!

Crane: Sh*t... too late.

Crane: Jade, Rais's men got here first.

Jade: F*ck! Okay, don't try to fight them. Just find the second one. Look for the smoke from the flare! The crate should be close by.

Jade: Crane, it's too close to sunset. You need to turn back. (Now!)

Crane: Jade, I'm almost there. I can do this.

Crane: Crane here. I'm about to recover an Antizin drop.

GRE: Good, Crane. This offers us a new strategy. Time to turn your attention to Rais. Listen closely.

GRE: It's very possible that Rais is our man. So if you find an airdrop containing Antizin, destroy it.

Crane: What?? Why?

GRE: It will force interaction with Rais. You can go under Brecken's auspices. As an ambassador, if you will.

Crane: But-there are civilians depending on this stuff...

GRE: Our plan is focused on the greater good. Remember that.

Crane: Jade, I'm at the airdrop. There's no Antizin here.

Jade: NONE? F*ck... F*CK. All right, get back here. And be careful... the nightmares are awake. Don't let them see you.

Crane: Oh Sh*t, must've heard me...

====The Tower====
Runner: Brecken, come on... I mean, we need Antizin, I know, but buying from Rais? You can't be serious...

Jade: For God's sake, I'll go. I'm not scared.

Brecken: Absolutely not. We've discussed that already.

Jade: We didn't discuss it. You just decided that I-

Crane: I'll go.

Jade: Are you serious?

Crane: Well... this Rais guy has never seen my face before. Clean slate. Right?

Brecken: Could you guys give Crane and me the room, please?

Brecken: You sure you're up for this?

Crane: Has to be done, doesn't it?

Brecken: Well, I'm not gonna argue. Rais's place is over here. Just... find out what this'll cost us, and come back in one piece.

===Pact with Rais===
Jade: Crane. Can you hear me?

Crane: Jade? Yeah, I copy. Something wrong?

Jade: No, no... it's... Listen, Crane... We all appreciate what you're doing.

Jade: And I know you're doing it to redeem yourself... because Amir died saving your life...

Crane: Look I'm doing it because if we don't get Antizin from Rais, people will start to die...

Jade: (You know.) I met Amir right after the outbreak. I didn't know him for long, but... he was the best, most decent man I've ever known.

Jade: But I just want you to know that I don't blame you. Amir knew the risk.

Jade: And Crane... We know that you too are taking a risk to do this for us.

Crane: I... Look, Jade... we'll talk when I get back with the Antizin, okay?

Jade: Okay. Just... just come back in one piece, alright?

====Rais' Garrison====
Crane: Okay, Rahim, I'm here.

Rahim: Make sure they see you and know who you are. You don't want to sneak up on them. That's a good way to catch a bullet.

Crane: Wish me luck, kid.

Rahim: Good luck, brother. You're going to need it.

Crane: Don't shoot! (Don't shoot!)

Guard: Hands up! What do you want, motherf*ck*r?

Crane: I'm here to see Rais. Brecken sent me.

Guard: Brecken? That *sshole in the Tower? All right, what does HE want?

Crane: I've come to make a deal.

Guard: What kinda deal?

Crane: The kind I make with Rais. Not with his flunkies.

Guard: ... All right. Let him through. This oughta be entertaining.

Rais: How long have we been friends, Osman?

Rais: We have been friends for a very long time. That is why I am so surprised that you would steal from me.

Tahir: Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

Rais: Now I give you a choice. Very simple. Your right hand? Or your left?

Osman: L-L-L-Left! ...

Rais: Hmmm... was that MY left, or YOUR left?

Rais: You have the look of the Tower about you. What do you want?

Crane: I'm here to make a deal.

Rais: A deal... for Antizin, no doubt. Desperate times.

Rais: And what do you offer in return? Your services? Your loyalty? ... Perhaps I shall take both.

Tahir: Talk to Karim. He's one of ours. Do what he asks of you, and Rais will consider giving your people some Antizin. Understood?

Crane: I don't seem to have a choice.

Rais: Perceptive.

Karim: There you are. Rais said you'd be coming by. I'm Karim.

Crane: Crane.

Karim: An American. I have an uncle there. Lives in Texas. You from Texas? You a cowboy?

Crane: I'm from Chicago.

Karim: Okay, Al Capone, we'll be in constant contact over the radio. That way I can make sure you get where you need to go.

Crane: And where's that exactly?

Karim: You're going to be climbing antenna towers and switching on shortwave radio modulators.

Karim: Most of my men are too slow, too fat, or too drunk to climb a tower like that without killing themselves.

Crane: And if I do this, I'll get the Antizin?

Karim: That's between you and Rais. I know better than to speak for him. Just don't fail. He doesn't handle disappointment very well.

Crane: Crane.

GRE: Report.

Crane: Just met Rais. There's no question: that's Suleiman. Guy's a psychopath. He's gone from ruthless politician to f*ck*ng warlord.

GRE: Is he aware of your affliation with us?

Crane: No. He think I'm just a guy from the Tower. In fact he's making me jump through hoops before he'll give me any Antizin.

GRE: Acknowledged. Continue to do as he asks. Remember, we need that file.

Crane: Great. Crane out.

====1st antenna====
Karim: Hey, Al Capone, you ready to do this?

Crane: What exactly am I doing?

Karim: Radio communication has been pretty spotty in the quarantine.

Karim: These modulators will help boost the signal so Rais can communicate with outposts at the far reaches of town.

Crane: That's a benefit for everyone-not just Rais.

Karim: Perhaps. But the emperor must monitor his empire.

Crane: Karim? I'm at the first antenna.

Karim: If the power's not on, you'll have to turn it on. There will be a switch in the small building at the antenna's base.

Crane: What the WHAT THE HELL-!

Karim: Crane! Why are you shouting?

Crane: I'm shouting because this f*ck*d-up infected motherf*ck*r with guts hanging out his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me!

Karim: ... Not a bad reason.

Crane: Oh, sh*t, Karim, someone already scavenged this thing for parts. There's nothing up here to switch on.

Karim: F*ck... I was afraid of that. All right, head to the next antenna tower. It's not too far from there.

Karim: Just use the zipline and head east. You'll see it.

====2nd antenna====
Crane: (Hey,) Karim, what do I do if the second transmitter is trashed?

Karim: The better question is, what will you do if you disappoint Rais? And the answer is probably, "Die horribly".

Crane: Karim, I'm at the second antenna tower, and the fence is electrified. I think someone's inside.

Karim: That will be Alexei. And perhaps his son, Kristov. I find them tiresome.

Karim: Don't let them stand in your way. You've got to get inside and turn on that transmitter.

Alexei: What the f*ck do you want?

Crane: I need to climb the tower.

Alexei: Why the hell would you want to do that?

Crane: For Rais. He asked me to.

Alexei: Rais? (Hah!) You don't look like one of his crew.

Crane: Fine, I'll just radio back and tell Rais that you wouldn't let me through.

Alexei: What? F*ck! No, I didn't say that! You want to climb? Fine. Go. Go.

(Kristov: I won't do this anymore!)

(Alexei: You better keep your voice down!)

(Kristov: I don't care who hears me!)

(Alexei: Kristov, what's wrong with you? We're trying to stay alive here.)

(Kristov: These guys are killers!)

(Alexei: Yes, they're murderers. That's why we stay safe.)

Crane: I sure hope this f*ck*ng climb was worth it.

Crane: And this thing's still intact. Let's see if it was worth the hassle...

Crane: Hey Karim, the second transmitter is up and running. Is it working?

Karim, do you hear me?

Karim: Loud and clear. Nice job. You know the way back, right?

Crane: Right.

Rahim: It was you, wasn't it?!

Crane: Rahim?

Rahim: The antennas! Brecken told me. Communication is crystal clear now!

Crane: Yeah, that was me. And now I'm on my way to see Rais again.

Rahim: And get the Antizin?

Crane: That's the deal.

Rahim: Good job, man. This helps everybody, but especially Dr. Zere and Dr. Camden.

Rahim: They can hear each other without static for the first time since... well, ever.

Rahim: See you back at the Tower!

Crane: I'll be there as soon as I can.

Spike: Hey! Crane! If you've got a second, I want to patch you through to somebody who really wants to talk to you.

Crane: Huh? Who?

Troy: Is this Kyle Crane?

Crane: ... Who wants to know?

Troy: My name is Troy. I lead a small group of survivors over in Sector 0. We call ourselves the Embers.

Troy: Sector 0 is completely sealed off, Mr. Crane, until you restored radio communication, we didn't know if anyone else in the city was still alive.

Troy: I just wanted to let you know how grateful we are. You've given us a small measure of hope.

Crane: Uh... well... I'm happy to help.

Troy: If there's ever any way we can help YOU, Mr. Crane, please don't hesitate to ask.

====Rais' Garrison====
Rais: Well! You not only did the job Karim asked of you, but you made it back in one piece. Bravo.

Crane: Can I get some Antizin now?

Rais: Did you think I would be satisfied so easily? You still have plenty to prove.

Crane: Look... we really need the drugs. Let me have them now, and then I'll come back and do whatever.

Rais: You'll get Antizin when I SAY you get it. Not one second before.

Rais: But as I have established, I am not unreasonable. Do all that I ask of you, and I will give you not one... but two crates of Antizin.

Crane: All right. Fine. What do you want me to do?

Rais: This will be a bit different from your exploits on the antennas. It will require a bit more... persuasion.

Rais: The imposing of one's will. The creation of one's own rules. That is what makes a man.

Rais: Do you live by your own rules, Crane? Or are you merely someone else's puppet? I believe I know the answer.

Rais: Talk to Karim, before I decide you are no longer worth the trouble.

Karim: Ah, my friend. Rais likes you, I can tell...

Crane: (Yeah?) How?

Karim: Because you are still among the living. The task at hand is as easy as can be. You simply have to make a few pickups from some nearby settlements.

Crane: Which ones?

Karim: The first is Jaffar's Wheelstation. It's just east of here.

Karim: But bear in mind, not everyone you talk to today will be in a... cooperative state of mind. I'm sure you can be convincing, though, no?

Crane: I guess I'll have to be.

Crane: Crane here.

GRE: Report.

Crane: Another job for Rais. This one's pretty dirty. He's forcing me to collect the money he's extorting from a nearby village.

GRE: Just do what he asks and stay close to him. Remember what's at stake.

Crane: Yeah... Crane out.

====Jaffar's Wheelstation====
Crane: Karim? I'm by the Wheelstation.

Karim: Took you long enough. Get the job done, and make it fast. This is just the first stop.

Crane: You Jaffar?

Jaffar: Who wants to know?

Crane: My name isn't important. What's important is that Rais sent me. And that you owe him some money.

Jaffar: I've never seen you before. For all I know you're just some random *sshole. F*ck off.

Crane: Tell you what. How about I break both your legs and drag you through the streets back to Rais's place, huh? Then he can explain to you that you should've cooperated.

Jaffar: Okay, okay, Jesus! You ARE one of Rais's thugs. You guys are the only ones who'd act this sh*tty.

Jaffar: Here, here's your money, take it.

Crane: And if I have to come back here...

Jaffar: You won't get any more attitude! Mi casa, su casa. Just don't hurt me, all right?

Crane: Karim, it's me. (So,) I just threatened to break an old man's legs.

Karim: And it worked, didn't it? Next you collect the tribute from the Fishermen's Village.

Karim: Head east, to the tunnel entrance. Their messenger always meets us there.

Brecken: Crane. How you doing, mate?

Crane: I'm... running errands for Rais. He wields a lot of power. Scares a lot of people.

Brecken: D*mn right, he does.

Brecken: Listen, mate, time's getting short. We're almost out of Antizin, and much as I hate to admit it, I'm getting worried.

Crane: I'm doing the best I can out here, Brecken.

Brecken: I know. I know. I understand. I just want you to be aware of the stakes.

Crane: I'm infected too, remember? Believe me, I'm motivated.

Brecken: All right... all right. Here's hoping you can make it back to the Tower soon.

Crane: What the f*ck was that?!

Crane: (Hey!) Karim, I just saw something I've never seen before. This huge, bloated Infected just f*ck*ng exploded!

Karim: Yeah, we call them bombers. Some of our guys use them to kill other Infected.

Karim: Shoot them and they take out everything in a three-meter radius.

Crane: Are you kidding me?

Karim: Keep your distance and you'll be fine. But what about the courier? Was he there?

Crane: No, I didn't see anybody, just f*ck*ng zombies.

Karim: All right. You'll have to go to the village directly, I suppose. Look for a man named Gursel.

====Fishermen's Village====
Crane: Okay, Karim, I'm outside the village, but there's a whole horde of Infected in there.

Karim: So clear them out. We get paid for protection. Do some protecting.

Crane: I don't know if I can take out that many by myself.

Karim: Sure you can. Because if you don't, you'll have to deal with Rais.

Karim: And you remember what I said about Rais when he's disappointed.

Crane: I gotta get that gate closed before more of those f*ck*rs get inside...

Fisherman: Who is it?

Crane: Hey, I'm looking for someone in charge here. Rais sent me...

Fisherman: You want Gursel. Check the big house in the center of the village.

Fisherman: He lives upstairs. Just be careful around his woman. She's hell on wheels.

Crane: Um... thanks...

Fisherman: Ye... Yes? Who-who goes there?

Crane: I'm here on Rais's behalf. I'm supposed to pick something up.

Fisherman: Oh my God, that's one of Rais's men! What do I do?!

Woman: Just tell him to go away. Do it nice and maybe he'll leave us alone. Better yet, send him to Gursel - he'll know what to do.

Fisherman: Please, we don't know anything. Go talk to Gursel, he lives above the store.

Fisherman: Yeah?!

Crane: Hey... Rais sent me here to pick something up for him.

Fisherman: You won't find it here... not here, not in this house.

Fisherman: Not anywhere around this house! Gursel! Gursel is the one you're looking for!

Crane: Hey! Anybody in there?!

Gursel: (Sshh!) Not so loud. You'll draw the monsters.

Crane: (Look.) I got rid of them. But you better reinforce that gate before more show up.

Gursel: You got rid of them? All of them?

Crane: Rais sent me. Are you Gursel?

Gursel: Oh - you work for Rais. Should've known this was too good to be true.

Ayla: You've taken enough! You can't have any more! Firkin, tell him!

Gursel: Ayla, please. Just let me talk to the man.

Ayla: You can't just push us around like this! Firkin's gonna kick your ass! Do it, Firkin! Kick his ass!

Gursel: For God's sake, Ayla!

Gursel: Look, I don't want any trouble. But we already paid up this month. You're gonna bleed us dry.

Crane: That is ENTIRELY not my problem. Rais wants his payment. So you make the payment, or things get bad for you... AND your woman.

Ayla: You can't threaten us! Kick his ass, Firkin!

Gursel: GIVE ME A BREAK, Ayla! (Alright.) Fine. Here. This is all of it.

Ayla: Pfffft. A real man would've kicked his ass.

Crane: I'll leave you to it. Sounds like you have bigger problems than money.

Crane: Okay, Karim, I got Gursel's money. I f*ck*ng hate myself now, but I got the money.

Karim: The self-hatred fades eventually. Just one pick-up to go, at the ferry station on the old pier.

Crane: There's a ferry?

Karim: There was until the navy sent it to the bottom of the bay.

Karim: Dozens of people were stranded there, waiting for another one that never came...

Crane: So there's a settlement there.

Karim: Head east and you'll find it.

Crane: Are there any boats left?

Karim: Yes, but any boat that tries to leave the bay gets blown right out of the water.

====Ferry====
Crane: I'm here to make a pick up for Rais.

Morgan: Back already? We just paid off you blood suckers...

Crane: Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just trying to get by like everybody else.

Morgan: Yeah? So are we. Rais said he'd protect us if we paid him, but so far all he's done is take our money. There's no "protection". Just threats. You any different?

Crane: Look, all I want to do is get this over with. What's it going to take? Do I need to point out how easy it would be to set this entire place on fire?

Morgan: Jesus Christ. You people are f*ck*ng monsters.

Morgan: All my money's in that satchel. Take it, and get the f*ck out.

Crane: For what it's worth... this isn't something I want to do. I'd rather be helping you guys.

Morgan: And yet you're still doing it, aren't you?

Crane: Okay, Karim, I made the collection at the Ferry Station. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to Hell.

Karim: Join the club. Now, come back and claim your prize. Good job today.

Brecken: Crane! Crane, do you copy?

Crane: I copy. What's wrong?

Brecken: Someone's turned on the 18th floor! We're doing our best to contain the situation, but...

Brecken: I can't sugar-coat this, Crane. We need Antizin right F*CK*NG now.

Crane: Rais has promised me two crates, Brecken. Two crates. I'm doing this sh*t as fast as I can, I swear.

Brecken: Just... God. Just hurry. Please.

Karim: Crane. How close are you?

Crane: I don't know - about halfway back, I guess.

Karim: Good. I need you to make a quick detour.

Crane: Why?

Karim: One of our patrols went off the grid somewhere near the market.

Crane: How is that my problem?

Karim: I'm making it your problem. See if you can find them or don't bother coming back.

Crane: Karim, I think I found your lost patrol. Something ripped them limb from limb.

Karim: Search the bodies. Look for some blueprints in a small envelope.

Karim: And don't damage them! They're worth more than all those dead *ssholes put together.

Karim: Did you find the envelope?

Crane: Not yet. Wait a sec.

Crane: Holy sh*t!

Crane: Okay. Got it.

Karim: Good. Bring it back to me right away. You're going to be a hero around here.

Crane: So, I think it's safe to say Rais isn't the most popular person in town, huh?

Karim: No, but he is the most feared. And you know the old saying? "It is better to be feared than loved if one cannot be both".

Crane: Machiavelli.

Karim: Correct. Smart fellow, that one.

====Rais' Garrison====
Crane: All right, here are the blueprints.

Karim: Excellent. You're a lot more dependable than most of these drunks. Rais is waiting for you. Maybe we can work together again sometime.

Crane: God, I hope not.

Rais: If you show them compassion, they will see it as weakness.

Rais: Give them a hand and they will take your whole arm. Understand? I give you shelter, I give you bread, women, bullets... and you cannot even complete a simple task.

Rais: I should send every one of you to the pit.

Rais: Ah. The Tower lackey returns. Do you have something for me, "friend"?

Crane: Yes I do.

Crane: Now it's time for you to give me what you promised. Two crates of Antizin.

Rais: I think not...

Rais: Your loyalty to the Tower is nothing but blind obedience, Crane. A coward's submission to false hierarchies.

Rais: You follow their rules as thoughtlessly as you follow mine. Like a good little dog.

Crane: Look, we had a deal!

Rais: Your people need that Antizin. Now more than ever, I would surmise.

Rais: But any man who follows someone else's rules is no man at all. Here... I will allow you this much.

Crane: You promised me two crates of it. This is only five vials!

Rais: If you want more... I present you with an opportunity.

Rais: The athlete. "The Scorpion". Jade Aldemir. She is one of your number... Bring her to me.

Rais: I have an arena, where men fight for our amusement. I would have the Scorpion fight for us. I am curious how long it will take for someone of her caliber to... break.

Crane: What? ... no. No! Forget it. I'm not doing it.

Rais: I hear no true conviction in your voice, Crane. You have not yet made your choice, I can tell.

Rais: Will you be a dog and save the dwellers of the Tower? Or will you be a man, and save the maiden?

Rais: Go. And think about it.

Crane: Ah, sh*t.

Crane: Crane here.

GRE: Report.

Crane: I'm no longer cooperating with Rais. He wanted me to kidnap Jade Aldemir and dump her with him, so he can make her fight in his pit.

GRE: Yes? And? Was that it?

Crane: What do you mean, "Was that it?" I'm not a f*ck*ng human trafficker!

GRE: You seem to have forgotten how much is riding on this file, Crane.

GRE: If Rais wants one girl, then give her to him. You'll be there to keep an eye on her, won't you?

Crane: What the-how can you-what the F*CK kind of humanitarian outfit are you guys? And for that matter, if this project file can "save the world", why keep it a f*ck*ng secret?

GRE: We're not paying you to be insubordinate, Crane. GET THIS DONE.

Crane: Oh, f*ck you, *sshole.

====The Tower====
Jade: Do you have the Antizin? Give it to me.

Crane: So what happened?

Jade: One person turned, and had a couple of other people trapped. We could've sealed off that one apartment, but Brecken... wanted to save as many lives as possible...

Jade: It went bad. Somebody had to make the call... Now we've lost the entire floor. Including... including a couple of kids.

Jade: You'd better talk to Brecken. I have to get these meds to Lena.

Brecken: This is where we get the announcements about the Antizin drops. And they've just... stopped.

Brecken: There were KIDS in there. I... I froze. Lena had to step up... Maybe she should be in charge.

Brecken: What the f*ck, Crane, I'm no leader! I'm a g*dd*mn parkour instructor!

Crane: So-all the free running. That was you? Brecken, you showed these people how to survive.

Brecken: You know what my pockets were full of when I showed up in Harran? F*ck*ng business cards.

Brecken: I was hoping to drum up some more students. Maybe get enough so I could save up and buy a house, instead of that poxy little flat I've been renting.

Brecken: Listen... I'm going to go talk to Rais myself.

Crane: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on a minute. Brecken, these people still need you. Just give me some time, all right? There's got to be another way. A better way.

Brecken: ... Fine. I'll wait. But no for long.

Crane: Rahim? Rahim - what're you doing up here?

Rahim: Hey, Crane.

Rahim: Can I trust you?

Crane: How much've you had to drink, kid?

Rahim: Can I or not?

Crane: .. Yeah. What's up?

Rahim: See that skyscraper? The scouts found a volatile nest in there. We take that out, and then running missions at night? We could totally do that.

Rahim: So I'm thinking, if we planted some explosives...

Crane: Oh, Jesus. (Rahim.) You're not still on that?

Rahim: Crane, we have to do this! As long as that nest is there, we'll never be able to gather up enough Antizin! It would WORK...

Rahim: We make a good team, raaAHH!

Rahim: Sh*t - sh*t! (Oh my!) Don't drop me don't drop me!

Rahim: Oh f*ck! See? Told ya we make a good team!

Crane: Look, Rahim... we don't have any explosives. None. The closest thing to what you're talking about are Spike's firecrackers. That's impossible.

Rahim: You don't know what it's like!

Rahim: All I can do is watch. Sit on my ass and watch everything happen and do nothing.

Rahim: I don't want to die here, Crane. Not like this. Not... helpless. If I go out, I'd rather go out doing something.

Crane: What's this?

Rahim: I was set to fly out on Sunday. They quarantined us on Thursday. I already had my bags packed.

Crane: I'll... look, I'll keep my eyes open, okay? If there's some way we could make this happen...

Rahim: Whatever.

Crane: This is Crane. Do you copy?

GRE: What do you want, Crane?

Crane: I want you to start the Antizin drops again! At least near the Tower. These people need help.

GRE: We put you in Harran to find our file, not to play Mother Teresa... Or does this mean you've reconsidered Rais's proposal?

GRE: Perhaps Ms. Aldemir would even be willing to cooperate. Test her skills in a new environment.

Crane: You start giving us some Antizin, and then... then we'll talk about what Rais wants.

GRE: Oh, it's "us" now, is it? Well, I'm afraid your request is out of the question in any case.

GRE: Things have gotten a bit... strained with the Ministry. Resuming the airdrops would not be politically advantageous at the moment.

Crane: You *ssholes take the f*ck*ng cake, you know that? You and your f*ck*ng "file".

Crane: I'll locate the file for you. But I'm gonna take a good long look at it before I decide what to do about it.

Jade: Crane. This is Jade. Do you copy?

Crane: Loud and clear. What can I do for you?

Jade: I don't know how much time we have, so, the short version: I need your help.

Jade: Rais has turned an abandoned school into a supply dump...

Jade: ... and I think it may be where he's storing his Antizin.

Jade: If you and I sneak in there, we could get all the meds the Tower needs. Are you with me?

Crane: Yeah. I'm with you.

Jade: Great - meet me in one of the box cars on the train trestle near the school.

Crane: Okay. And listen, Jade... If we don't find that Antizin, I need to talk to you about something.

Jade: About what?

Crane: Another option, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now let's see what we can find in that school.

===Siblings===
Jade: (Hey.) Come here. You should see this.

Jade: Something is going on at the school. Tahir's men have been hauling boxes out of that place for hours. We need to get a closer look.

Crane: What's in the boxes?

Jade: Good question. If it's Antizin, we need it.

Survivor: We're approaching the front gate.

Crane: Jade, where... sh*t.

Survivor: RUN!

Crane: F*ck*ng Tahir. That guy should die in a fire. We-

Crane: F*ck, where did she go?

Crane: How many bandits are inside?

Jade: I only saw the ones that went in after Tahir, but I'm sure there's more.

Jade: We should use different entrances - we'll cover more ground, and we'll make less noise moving separately.

====School====
Crane: Okay, Jade, I'm inside.

Jade: Check the classrooms. That's the most likely place for them to store supplies.

Jade: They should be marked somehow. Military jargon is pretty straight forward, so it shouldn't be hard to notice.

Crane: I can't get through that way...

Loudspeaker: Hurry up! We don't have all day for this sh*t, and this is the last place I want to be at night!

Loudspeaker: Did any of you idiots think to check the basement? Of course not, because the key is still up here! Get your sh*t together!

Bandit: Who the f*ck are you? Guys! There's somebody in here!

Jade: Turn that d*mn thing off! We're gonna have walkers swarming towards the school!

Loudspeaker: We got somebody in here that don't need to be! Find him and kill him!

Jade: For f*ck's sake, Crane! Turn that d*mn alarm off or you're going to get overrun!

Jade: Find the janitor's office. The switch ought to be in there.

Bandit: Burn in hell, you b*st*rd!

Crane: Jade, no luck with any Antizin. Looks like we'll have to talk about... that other option. I still have Classroom C to search, though.

Jade: The basement's pretty big. Find the key. I'll meet you down there.

Jade: Give me a hand here, would you?

Crane: Yeah, sure.

Jade: GOD, Crane, you're such an OAF! Why don't you just stick your head out the door and shout, "Here we are! Come get us!".

Crane: Hey, sometimes there's nothing wrong with the direct... approach.

Jade: Holy sh*t.

Jade: That's... plastic explosives, right?

Crane: Listen. You take this stuff and get back to the Tower. I'll deal with these *ssholes.

Jade: Don't be ridiculous! We'll fight them together!

Crane: And risk letting them keep this much ordinance? No, just go. I got this. Meet me back at the Tower.

Jade: Promise me you won't let Rahim near that hive!

Crane: What? Of course! I promise, I promise, just go!

====Outside the school====
Jade: Crane? You've said we needed to talk about other options if we didn't find any Antizin.

Crane: ... and we will, but right now let's deal with these explosives, ok?

Jade: Okay, listen. I'll give the explosives to Sa'id, and you talk to Rahim. Make sure he stays away from that hive.

Crane: Will do. Don't worry.

Jade: Don't worry? Right...

====The Tower====
Rahim: Crane! Sa'id told me about the explosives you guys found! How perfect is that?!

Rahim: Jade gave them to him - Sa'id used to be on a bomb squad, so he knows about that stuff.

Crane: Yeah, kid, that was a lucky find. Would've been better to turn up some Antizin, though.

Rahim: My buddy Omar's making sure Sa'id's putting good timers on those things. We have to be able to get our asses out of there before they blow.

Crane: Whoa, "we"? There's no "we" in this. I mean, yeah, that nest needs to go. And now it's possible. But if it gets done, I'm doing it on my own.

Rahim: But... it's my plan!

Crane: And I will execute it perfectly. I promise.

Rahim: But... ah, sh*t. There's no use arguing with you, is there? Fine. I'll contact you as soon as Sa'id's finished with the charges.

Crane: Rahim, do we have a deal?

Rahim: I guess...

Crane: Do we have a deal?

Rahim: Yes, we have a deal.

Crane: (Okay.) One more thing... I keep seeing this bizarre kind of Infected. Is Dr. Zere out at his trailer? I'ld like to talk to him about it.

Rahim: Nah, he's down in Sickbay, visiting Dr. Lena.

Crane: Thanks, kid. I'll see you soon.

Crane: Hey, Doc. You got a minute?

Zere: Oh-it's... Kane, yes? How can I help you?

Crane: Crane. Remember when I told you about that weird Infected I saw? You know, the one who took one look at me and hauled ass away?

Crane: Well, I just saw another one, and it did the same thing.

Zere: Hmmm... I believe I HAVE heard your colleagues talk about those creatures. "Bolters", they call them.

Zere: Apparently they favor certain areas of town over others, but only appear at night... I don't suppose you could catch one, and bring me a sample of its flesh?

Zere: You see, a thought occurred to me - a long shot, I realize - but if these creatures favor areas where I left my experimental "bait"...

Zere: Well. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Please do obtain a sample. But it has to be fresh, so you have to get it back to me quickly.

Crane: OK. And where exactly do I find these things?

Zere: I'm told that quartermaster chap has been keeping track of them.

Quartermaster: What can I do for you?

Crane: Doc Zere says you know where I should look for these, uh, "bolters"...

Crane: Super-fast Infected? Covered in big green blisters?

Quartermaster: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can point you in the right direction.

Quartermaster: Here, here, and here. Though, you ask me, if trouble don't come lookin' for you, no reason to go lookin' for trouble.

Crane: Words to live by. Thanks.

====Bolter hunting====
Spike: Crane, you there?

Crane: (Hey!) What's up, Spike?

Spike: Just FYI... if you need me, I'll be at the ferry station, helping Morgan prep the barge.

Spike: Strangest thing, he said he got shaken down by some young man who sounded an awful lot like you.

Spike: You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

Crane: Hey, I've gotta run! I'll talk to you later, Spike!

Crane: Okay, Doc... here comes your chunk of zombie guts.

Zere: Ah, Crane! Come in, come in! Did you get the samples I asked for?

Zere: Excellent, excellent! I was just telling Dr. Camden about you.

Camden: Hello, Mr. Crane. Glad to have you working with us. You sound like an impressive individual.

Zere: Interesting stuff, what passes for blood in this creature. Photosensitive. Quite deadly if used on a weapon, I'd wager. But I digress!

Zere: My last bit of reagent here... and a reserve vial of...

Zere: Oh my word! This tissue! It's testing positive for the recombined virus! Camden! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

Camden: The meat experiment worked!

Zere: When I dosed the meat samples with the altered strain? It's HAD AN EFFECT! This could explain all the different mutations!

Zere: But I can't. Camden could... he has the equipment... but we have no way to get the research to him.

Crane: You can talk to him on the radio. Why not share info that way?

Camden: There's too much data, Crane. It would take years. We'd both be dead and gone before he finished.

Zere: "Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink."

Crane: What if I delivered this stuff to you, Dr. Camden? By hand? The data and the tissue samples both?

Camden: Crane... getting from there to here would be insanely dangerous.

Crane: But it could mean a cure, right?

Zere: You don't know how much this means, dear boy! To me, to all of us!

Zere: I'll contact you when everything's ready! You must go now! Much to do! Much to do!

====Rahim and Omar====
Rahim: Hey. Crane. You there? Omar and I went to blow up that nest.

Crane: (Wait.) You what?! F*ck*ng hell, Rahim, that was MY job!

Rahim: Oh, right, 'cause you're more qualified to handle explosives than I am! You're just a godd*mn tourist! But listen - we messed up.

Rahim: Messed up bad.

Crane: What happened? Where are you?

Rahim: On the overpass and it's all going to sh*t...

Crane: Head to the trainyard! Find a place to hide! I'm on my way!

Rahim: Omar! Behind you! BEHIND YOU!

Crane: Rahim? Rahim! Godd*mn it!

Crane: Brecken! Brecken, do you copy?

Brecken: Yeah, I copy. What is it?

Crane: I'm on my way to get Rahim.

Brecken: Rahim? He's here in the Tower.

Crane: No, he's not. He and Omar went to blow that nest, and now they're in trouble.

Brecken: THEY WHAT?! F*ck! Where'd they get the explosives?

Crane: I... look, I stole them from Rais.

Brecken: Oh, Jesus H. CHRIST.

Crane: I'm close. I'll get him to safety, Brecken.

Brecken: You d*mn well better. You save him, you hear me? You save him, so I can kick his f*ck*ng ass... Does Jade know about this?

Crane: No, she doesn't.

Brecken: Well for God's sake, don't tell her. She'll go out looking for him and I don't need her getting herself killed too. GODD*MN IT! -

Crane: Oh, sh*t... This is not good...

Crane: Rahim... where the hell are you?

Crane: Brecken! It's me. I found Omar's body on the overpass. No trace of Rahim.

Brecken: Sh*t... Any idea where he'd go?

Crane: I told him to hide in the train yard.

Brecken: You find him! You hear me? That little b*st*rd better be alive...

Rahim: THAT'S RIGHT! KEEP COMING, YOU MOTHERF*CK*RS! I'LL SEND YOU ALL TO HELL! Crane: Rahim!

Rahim: Crane! I didn't think I'd make it, so I armed the bombs! They'll blow in less than five minutes!

Crane: Sh*t - kid, you're bleeding!

Rahim: Huh? Oh - I cut myself. It's nothing. F*ck, just plant the bombs!

Crane: (Alright.) Don't move! Got it? I'll be right back!

Crane: Rahim, can you hear me? Where the f*ck am I going with these things?

Rahim: There's a sewer entrance here in the terminal, near the west wall! Use that tunnel - it'll take you straight to the hive!

Crane: Okay, I'm back on the surface.

Rahim: See that big-ass culvert over to your right? Head through it!

Rahim: Once you get into the building, head up the ramp and get up to the floor above! You need to put the bomb on one of the big support columns!

Crane: Okay, first one's set!

Rahim: Okay, pay attention! Find some stairs and get to the next floor up!

Rahim: You're looking for another column like the first one!

Crane: All right, got it!

Rahim: It's done? Great... Now get your ass out of there...

Crane: Rahim, it worked man! Your plan worked, kid! ... Rahim? Hey, do you copy? ... Sh*t.

Crane: Rahim, it's me! I did it!

Crane: Rahim! You should have seen it!

Crane: The whole d*mn building came down!

Crane: (OH!) SH*T!

Crane: No no no - Rahim, stop!

Crane: Rahim, it's me! It's me, buddy! It's Crane! Oh Jesus... Rahim, stop!

Crane: That's a f*ck*ng bite wound...

Crane: You GODd*mn STUPID f*ck*ng KID!

Crane: Oh God... Jade...

Brecken: Crane! Do you copy? What's going on?

Crane: Brecken... Rahim... Rahim's dead.

Brecken: F*ck!... Get back here. And don't say a word to Jade. Not yet.

====The Tower====
Crane: Brecken?

Brecken: How did he die?

Crane: I... I had to kill him.

Crane: It was too late. He turned. I had no choice, I swear.

Crane: Look, he was my friend too. He was the best one I had here.

Brecken: I know. I know... He frustrated the sh*t out of me sometimes, but I loved him like he was my own kin.

Brecken: Another dead friend. Another dead brother...

Crane: I trusted him. I trusted him with those explosives... God, maybe if I didn't leave him there... he would still be alive.

Crane: Oh, no... Jade-

Brecken: Jade. Wait!

Crane: Jade - God D*MN it!

Brecken: Just - just give her time. She needs to grieve.

Brecken: Zere! SH*T!

Brecken: Get down there! We can't let them take him!

===The Pit===
Survivor: This is an emergency!!! Au secours!

Survivor: Hey! Anyone?! I could really use some help!

Survivor: Can anyone hear me!!!??? Help!

Maalik: There's no one inside. They took Zere and drove away.

Crane: Sh*t... !

Crane: Brecken, Zere's been kidnapped. His trailer's on fire.

Brecken: God d*mn it! You see what happens when you f*ck with Rais? You should never have hit that school!

Brecken: Some of our people spotted a big knot of bandits heading back to Rais's Garrison. That's got to be where they took Zere.

Brecken: You go there and you find him and you bring him back alive. You hear me?

Brecken: Hurry up, Crane. We gotta get him back!

Brecken: I hope you're on your way to Rais' Garrison. You better be!

Brecken: Where the hell are you?! Have you gone after Zere? What the hell are you waiting for?

Brecken: Crane - look, I know I've been hard on you. But after what happened to Rahim... and now Dr. Zere, you have to understand...

Crane: Brecken, there's no apologies necessary. And don't worry, I'll bring Zere back in one piece.

Brecken: Just be careful, okay? And I'm sorry about Rahim. I know you were close. Hell, I loved that stupid kid too.

====Rais' Garrison====
Crane: Brecken? The Garrison's shut down... The doors are sealed off... I don't think I can get in.

Brecken: Find another way in, then. Check the back. But don't take any stupid chances.

Brecken: Those b*st*rds'll rip you apart if they get the opportunity.

Crane: Okay - found an entrance. Can't say it was easy, though. I'm going in.

Brecken: Just keep your eyes open. Good luck in there.

Crane: Crane here. I could REALLY use some GRE support right now.

GRE: That's too bad, Agent Crane. This is the Ministry of Defense.

Crane: The f*ck- What the hell is going on? What happened to the GRE?

GRE: The Global Relief Effort's position here has been... diminished.

GRE: We are in charge now, and we have declared Harran a Code One Target Zone.

Crane: Wait, wait, wait... just hang on! You can't just carpet-bomb this place! There are still hundreds of innocent people in here! Maybe thousands!

GRE: Irrelevant. We're doing this to protect BILLIONS of lives. Surely you can understand that.

Crane: Okay, okay - just listen! There's this scientist in here named Zere, and he's been doing research on a cure! And he's really close! I've seen the research! If you bomb the city...

GRE: ... Acknowledged. The chances of one scientist in a wrecked city coming up with useful results are negligible at best, but... you have 48 hours.

Crane: Sh*t... it's broken. Maybe I could pry it open...

Crane: And we're in...

Crane: And where are you, old friend?

Crane: Brecken, I couldn't find Zere inside. The building looks empty, though.

Brecken: There's an underground level... Maybe he's down there.

Zere: Who is it? Who's there?

Crane: Relax, Doc. It's me.

Zere: Crane! Thank God! Listen, this is important! I'm not safe anymore- obviously-but my research must not die with me!

Crane: You're not gonna die, Doc! But right now we have to get out of here, so please, lower your voice.

Zere: Oh! Oh. Yes. All right. But understand-my research. It must reach Dr. Camden! That's why I gave the packages to Jade.

Zere: I know you said you would deliver them, but she was there, and time being of the essence-

Crane: Doc?

Rais: So. It takes no more than the false hope of rescue to loosen the good doctor's lips.

Rais: Hunt the Scorpion down. Spare no resource.

Tahir: With pleasure. And these two? What should we do with them?

Zere: You'll never find her! Never! And I'll never talk! You'll get nothing from me!

Rais: I am less concerned with making you talk now, Doctor, than I am in preventing your escape.

Crane: You sadistic f*ck! He's an old man!

Rais: Give the doctor some first aid.

Rais: And take Crane to the pit.

====The Pit====
Rais: Stand him up.

Crane: Oh sh*t... Doc!

Rais: You come to us like a snake in the grass. Here, in a city of lies, you are the biggest liar of (them) all.

Crane: What're you talking about? ... Answer me, motherf*ck*r!

Rais: Yes, lose control. That is what you Americans are so good at, after all. If I-

Rais: Not bad.

Rais: Clear out the corpses. Leave Crane.

Rais' soldier: Yes sir!

Rais: Word of your feats here will spread. Such a shame you'll be a corpse by then.

Rais: Is this your first feeble attempt at controlling your own destiny, Crane? Too little, too late, I fear.

Rais: Impressive. For a walking dead man.

(Crane: No, no! No!)

Rais: You have provided some quality entertainment for my men. Too bad it's a one-time performance.

Rais: This will only prolong the inevitable. But try to make the best of it.

Rais: Let no one say I never gave you anything, Crane.

Rais: Your skills no longer come as a surprise, Crane. The GRE selects its operatives well.

Crane: Oooohh sh*t.

Rais: Lower the platform!

Rais: Drop the weapon.

Rais: Chaos, Crane. Chaos is the one true order of things. To pretend otherwise is the sheerest folly. Allow me to demonstrate.

Rais: Basaam. Can you hear me?

Basaam: Loud and clear.

Rais: Publish the file.

Basaam: Right away, sir... Annnd... there. It is sent.

Crane: You maniac! You've just doomed thousands of innocent people! That's what you get with your f*ck*ng chaos!

Rais: You don't know what was in that file, do you, Crane? You only prove my point for me. The GRE plans to weaponize the virus, not cure it. Rais: They're only interested in profit. Not saving lives... and by following their rules, you have become their trained monkey... Pathetic!

Rais: All right. Kill him.

Crane: Doc - come on, let's get you out of here.

Zere: Crane. Save these people... They don't deserve all this.

(Rais: You! Give me the torch!)

Rais: ... CRANE!

Rais: What are you swine waiting for? SHOOT HIM!

Crane: I'm sorry, Doc!

Crane: Run...

Crane: Sh*t! Almost got me...

Crane: F*ck!

Crane: D*mn it!

====Slums====
(Crane: Oh sh*t! No! Not now.)

(Crane: No. Not this again!)

Crane: Zere... Zere's dead.

Crane: Sh*t!

Brecken: You alright?

Crane: Where am I?

Brecken: I had to hide you at the pier. Half of Rais's men are after you. Whatever you've done, it's really put them on the warpath.

Crane: I have to talk to Jade. Zere gave her his research...

Brecken: She took it to Camden-or she tried to.

Brecken: Camden radioed that Rais's thugs had found his lab, so he flooded it with biters and barricaded himself in the middle. Now, he's trapped.

Brecken: Then the connection failed. We haven't been able to raise him since.

Crane: I'm going after her. How was she getting in? That part of town is sealed off.

Brecken: There's a group called "The Saviors" that smuggles people through.

Brecken: They have a den at Nico's Bar in the cauldron, near the highway. The contact's name is Cenk.

Crane: Do you have enough runners to cover air drops?

Brecken: The air drops stopped 36 hours ago. There won't be any more. We're out of time, Crane.

Crane: Sh*t... all right. I don't know if I can fix this, but I'm sure as hell going to try.

Brecken: You know, most men in your situation would crawl in a hole and hide. Hats off to you, mate. And good luck.

Timur: (Hey.) Crane? Here's your gear, take it. Best regards from Karim.

Crane: (Karim, huh?) Uh... (if you see him,) thank him for me.

===The Saviors===
Brecken: Crane? One more thing, mate. Do you remember that girl from Sector 0? Troy...

Crane: Yeah... she called me to thank me after I get the antenna towers working.

Brecken: You should contact her when you get there.

Crane: Yes, that's a good idea. Thanks, Brecken.

Brecken: Right... you take care!

====At the cauldron====
Cenk: What do you want?

Crane: I'm looking for the Saviors.

Cenk: Don't know what you're talking about.

Crane: I'm one of Brecken's men. From the Tower.

Cenk: I don't care where you're from. Get your ass outta here, or I will stop being so f*ck*ng polite.

Crane: Listen, I know you're smuggling people out of the Slums. There's a girl who came through. Jade?

Cenk: I think you better get the hell out of here.

Crane: (No.) Just listen! I cut Rais up, and now his whole godd*mn gang is after me. I could use some cooperation here.

Cenk: You? You're the one who chopped Rais's hand off?

Crane: Yeah. And now I have to get to Sector 0!

Cenk: What's your name?

Crane: Crane.

Cenk: Well, Crane, you're in for some heartbreak if you think going to Sector 0 will get you off Rais's sh*t list. But... wait here.

Cenk: I got a guy here who claims he's the one who took Rais's hand off... Crane... ... Yeah, that's what he said... Really? Are you sure? ... huh, ok... right.

Cenk: Come here.

Cenk: Okay. We'll get you to the other side.

Crane: All right, when?

Cenk: Right now.

Crane: What about payment?

Cenk: What you did to Rais - that's more than enough payment for us. Go to the collapsed tunnel that led to Old Town.

Cenk: Knock at the door that leads to the sewers. Someone will take good care of you.

Crane: Will do. Thanks.

Cenk: Nah, man. Thank YOU.

====Tunnels====
Hazan: Crane?

Crane: Yeah. That's me.

Hazan: Good to meet you. I'm Hazan. I'm going to be helping you change your scenery.

Crane: So did you take Jade through, too?

Hazan: Who?

Crane: She's from here. Dark hair. Pretty. Tough as nails.

Hazan: (Uhh.) Maybe. Don't know. We don't always ask names.

Sammy: Look, Dad! It's Mr. Crane!

Dawud: Well, well. Small world.

Crane: Dawud. We need to talk about your situation.

Dawud: Sorry about the wild goose chase, but I couldn't risk you tailing me. These guys are pretty serious about following their procedures.

Crane: This isn't fair to Salma.

Dawud: Salma and me are done.

Crane: That's not the point.

Dawud: So, what is? You got something in mind? I've still got a gun, you know.

Smuggler: Crane, We've got a rule. Everybody minds their own business. If you don't follow the rules, you don't go through.

Crane: No problem.

Hazan: Okay, from here on out, you're on your own. The route is marked. I'll stay in touch over radio. It's been a pleasure, my friend.

Smuggler: We need to do this one by one. And this man needs to go first.

Survivor: But he just got here. We've been here for hours!

Smuggler: I don't make the rules. Wait here!

Hazan: We try to keep the route clear, but there may be some Infected here and there. Shouldn't be a problem for you, though.

Hazan: Hey, friend. Sorry, but I had no choice. Rais has me by the balls.

Crane: What?! Hey! What did you do?!

Hazan: What I had to... What can I say? The world is an unforgiving place...

Crane: F*ck*ng sellouts.

Bandit: Sh*t, where are they? How long are we supposed to wait for them?

(Bandit: There he is!)

Crane: Brecken, do you copy? Crane here.

Brecken: What's going on, mate?

Crane: Tell everyone to stay away from the Saviors. They sold me out to Rais. I barely made it out alive.

Brecken: Sh*t. I hope you're okay. Be sure to contact Troy, when you get to Sector 0. She's the only friendly face you have over there.

Crane: Got it! Will do! Keep your fingers crossed for me.

====Old Town====
Crane: Here goes nothing... Jade? It's Crane. Do you copy? ... Jade? It's Crane! Can you hear me?

Crane: Dammit... All right. It's time for some local talent.

Crane: Troy. This is Crane. Do you copy?

Troy: Crane? It's great to hear from you! What can I help you with?

Crane: (Yeah.) I'm in your neck of the woods now, and I'd love to put our heads together. Where can I find you?

Troy: You're here? In the Zero? Fantastic! Have you seen a pair of towers, one taller than the other, with scaffolding around them?

Troy: We call that our "loft". Head that way. We'll be waiting.

===Find the Embers===
Crane: Dr. Camden? Do you copy? Crane here...

Crane: Camden, can you hear me?

Camden: Crane? Yes, yes, I hear you. What's going on?

Crane: I'm in Sector 0. Is Jade with you?

Camden: No, she hasn't been able to reach me yet... and even if she does manage to get here, it won't be easy getting in.

Camden: I had to barricade myself inside because of Rais and his thugs.

Crane: You okay?

Camden: I'm trapped inside my lab but safe. Are you coming my way?

Crane: Not yet, Doctor... first I have to find Jade and recover Zere's research.

Camden: Okay, I'll sit tight then... It's not like there's anywhere for me to go. Be careful out there, Crane.

====The Loft====
Michael: Hey, you're Crane, right?!

Crane: Yeah... that's me.

Michael: I'm Michael. Troy's waiting for you in our loft.

Michael: Good to have you here, Crane!

Savvy: Crane! It's a pleasure, mate! I'm Savvy... need anything technical, I'm your man! I've ALMOST rigged a way to break through the comm jamming!

Savvy: Come on, say hello to Troy!

Crane: I'm Kyle Crane. It's good to finally put a face with the voice.

Troy: You're looking for Jade Aldemir, aren't you?

Crane: Yeah, yeah... have you seen her? Do you know where she is?

Troy: Jade? This is Troy. Do you copy?

Jade: Go ahead, Troy.

Crane: Jade! It's Crane! Listen, I know you're headed for Dr. Camden, but his clinic's surrounded by zombies and Rais's thugs. Let me come and help you.

Jade: Crane... stay away from me. I hear your voice, and all I can see is my brother.

Crane: Please, just hear me out. The thing is... the GRE hired me. (Alright?)

Crane: I was supposed to find out where Rais sent this classified file, but that doesn't matter anymore, because the Ministry contacted me.

Crane: (Jade.) They were going to firebomb the city, but I talked them into waiting...

Crane: ...because they want that research that you're carrying. (Now,) We need to figure out some way to let them know that we've got it.

Jade: You b*st*rd. YOU B*ST*RD.

Crane: Jade... ? Jade! ... D*MN it.

Troy: Crane... the last time I spoke to her, she was at the University. It's due east from here. If what you just said is even a little bit true, you have to find her.

===Higher Education===
(Troy: Go! Time is of the essence.)

Troy: Crane? Troy here...

Crane: Copy. What is it, Troy?

Troy: Savvy has an idea of how to break through the radio jamming and contact the outside world.

Troy: He'll be working on that while you're busy looking for Jade.

Crane: That's fantastic! Let's hope he's on to something.

Troy: I'll be in touch.

Troy: And, if I may make a suggestion... avoid the Infected if you can, okay? They've always been dangerous, but now they're mutating into something even more deadly.

====The University====
Crane: Hey, buddy, have you seen a woman named Jade Aldemir? She's got long dark hair, she's tough as nails?

Guard: Yeah, she was walking to what's-his-name over there.

Crane: Thanks.

Crane: Jade? JADE! Are you here?

Fidan: Wh-who are you? What do you want?

Crane: No sign of Jade... dammit.

Crane: (Hey, hey.) Hey - can you help me? I'm looking for a young woman. Dark hair, petite, takes no sh*t from anyone? Her name's Jade Aldemir.

Fidan: Yes, she was here. You didn't miss her by too much. She waited around for a while with a big scowl on her face, and then took off.

Crane: God D*MN it. Did she say where she was going?

Fidan: No. But you're Crane, right? She left this for you.

Crane: That's Amir. Why would she have left me this... ?

Fidan: Well, I can't say for certain, but she did ask me to tell you, "Not again". Don't know what that's supposed to mean.

Crane: Looks pretty comfortable.

Spike: Crane! Good to see you again!

Crane: Spike?! Holy sh*t! How'd you get here?

Spike: Wasn't easy. Anyway, Brecken sends his best.

Spike: And listen, from now on you can always find me here, okay? Everything I had for you in the Slums, that'll all be here too, so feel free to use it.

Crane: Yeah. Thanks, Spike.

Spike: No problem, buddy. See you next time.

Crane: Jade, this is Crane. Do you copy? ... Jade, can you hear me? ... Nothing.

Crane: Troy, this is Crane. Do you copy?

Troy: Crane! I was just about to contact you! Savvy broke through the jamming and... I think you'd better get back here. You have to see this.

Crane: Why... ? What do I have to see?

Troy: You have to see it for yourself. Just... get back here, all right? I'm serious!

====The Loft====
Troy: No matter how many times I watch it, I still can't believe it.

Reporter: An internal Global Relief Effort document surfaced today that, if verified, implicates the GRE in a far-reaching criminal conspiracy.

Reporter: Instead of trying to find a cure for the Harran Virus, according to the file, the GRE had plans to weaponize it and sell it to the highest bidder. World-wide backlash has-

Troy: No, no, skip to the important bit.

Survivor: I was the last survivor left in the quarantine. I can't believe I made it out.

Survivor: I can't believe I'm still alive...

Reporter: We mourn all those who didn't survive, but as the President said in a speech here earlier today, life is for the living.

Reporter: Military troops have searched for survivors all over the quarantine, but now there's no one left besides the Infected.

Reporter: According to Colonel Taner, once his decontamination process is finished, the infection will be completely obliterated.

Crane: The Ministry did this. They're making their excuses to the rest of the world for destroying a city.

Troy: Look, Crane, before you go charging out of here-we already had an idea of how to send a message.

Troy: We were going to plant explosives in a building and set off fires in a pattern-something the zombies could never do.

Troy: Trouble is, we got a runner, Michael, over to the right building, but he can't get through to the top floors. Too many biters.

Troy: As much as I hate to admit it, none of the rest of us are strong enough to do this job...

Crane: Well, we've got to do something RIGHT F*CK*NG NOW, or you, me, Jade, and everybody else are going to get blown to bits.

Crane: Tell Michael I'm on my way... and while I'm doing that, can you get in touch with Jade? Try to get her to meet me?

Troy: You have my word.

===Public Face===
(Crane: Please! Not now!)

Michael: F*ck! I thought you were a biter!

Michael: Why you gotta sneak up on a guy like that?!

Michael: Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack.

Crane: I didn't mean to scare you, Michael.

Michael: Okay, okay... Troy said you were on your way. God, I'm glad she didn't see me jump like that. She'd NEVER take me seriously.

Crane: Got a little crush, huh?

Michael: How could I not? Have you met her? That's why I volunteered for this!

Crane: You're... risking your life with a horde of flesh-eating zombies to impress a girl?

Michael: Mate, before the outbreak, the most impressive thing I'd ever done was win a spelling bee.

Michael: Okay? Troy would've never even looked at me. So I'll take my opportunities where I can.

Crane: (Right.) Fair enough. Tell me what needs to happen here.

Michael: Well, okay, I tried to finish the job, but I couldn't get past the ninth floor.

Crane: Leave it to me.

Michael: What needs to happen is, you take these explosives, turn on the gas ovens, and plant charges in a few specific apartments.

Crane: And that'll make a pattern, huh? One nobody outside Harran could mistake as random?

Michael: If they can explain this sh*t away, we're all gonna be really f*ck*n' impressed.

Michael: Now, if you're ready, your first stop is on the tenth floor.

====At the apartment building====
Crane: What the... dammit!

Crane: Something must've blocked the shaft.

Crane: Aahhh SH*T... Dammit.

Michael: What's wrong? You okay?

Crane: Yeah... yeah. For now.

Crane: Michael, I'm on the tenth floor.

Michael: Great! Look for apartments 105, 106, 134 and 137.

Crane: Okay, I'm done with the first apartment.

Michael: Good work. Get to the next one.

Crane: All right, the second apartment's done.

Michael: D*mn, you're better at this sh*t than I am. Next you need - oh, sh*t.

Crane: What's wrong? Michael?!

Michael: I got some company here... Get back, you b*st*rds!

Crane: Michael, get out of there! Get to safety!

Michael: No! I can hold them off, and you have to finish the job! I'm not going anywhere until this is done!

Crane: Is that... Is that a child crying?

Crane: F*ck! What is this... ?!

Crane: Okay, all done!

Michael: Great! And, uh... if you could get back down here? I wouldn't turn down a helping hand at this point...

Michael: Listen... Hey! You sneaky f*ck*r! Jesus Christ!

Crane: Michael?

Michael: Listen, if I don't make it, you have to grab... get off me! ... grab the detonator, get the hell out of here and blow this place.

Crane: Michael! Get the f*ck out of there and head back to Troy! Right now! Just leave the detonator.

Crane: Michael?! Michael! Sh*t!

Crane: Sh*t... !

Crane: Okay. I hope you're all right, Michael...

====Old Town====
Troy: Crane, we see it! Great job!

Crane: (Thanks.) I hope it's enough... Have you had any contact with Jade?

Jade: Crane...

Crane: Jade! Is that you?!

Jade: Crane... I heard what you did... I SEE what you did.

Crane: So... do you believe me now, that I'm on your side?-

Crane: Those sons of B*TCH*S.

Jade: F*ck. Crane, if you're really on our side, you've got to contact the GRE. They must stop the Ministry from bombing the city!

Crane: I know, but I lost my one and only way to reach them...

Troy: Guys! Listen... Savvy's figured out a way to break through the jamming! He just needs your help to do it!

Crane: Okay! Jade, you heard that? We have to meet.

Jade: Yeah... all right. Meet me in that red building on Emerald Canal. We'll go from there.

Jade: ...and Crane... be careful. The Infected here are even more ferocious than the ones in the slums.

===Rendezvous===
Crane: Oh God! Jade! JADE!

(Inscription on wall: WHAT HAPPENS TO ASCORPION WHEN YOU CUT OUT ITS STING??? COME TO THE MUSEUM TO FIND OUT.)

Crane: Troy! This is Crane! Rais has taken Jade - he has her in some museum somewhere. Do you know what he's talking about?

Troy: Museum? Yes... Rais is using it as his headquarters. Crane... you can't go there. That place was built as a fortress... you'd be walking into a massive trap!

Crane: (No, no, no.) It's not subtle enough to be a trap. But there's got to be a way to sneak in, right? (I mean.) Some way to surprise them?

Troy: Let me think... uh... Tariq maybe?

Troy: He's the museum's curator. He should know something about the dungeons hidden beneath the fortress.

Crane: Good, I'll talk to him.

Troy: All right. There's a building with a rooftop garden. You'll find Tariq there.

Troy: And listen-if you get the chance, find yourself some new weapons. You'll need them.

===The Museum===
Michael: Hey, Crane! Nice to see you again.

Crane: Nice to see YOU in good shape, Michael. Stay out of trouble. (Alright?)

Michael: Yeah... I will.

Crane: Tariq?

Tariq: What do you want? We don't have anything here but a few scraps of food.

Crane: Relax. Troy sent me.

Tariq: Troy? Thank God. I've been a nervous wreck since I found this kid. He's got nobody to look out for him, but I'm not so good with kids, y'know?

Crane: That's not why I'm here.

Tariq: But... Troy promised she'd send someone.

Crane: I need to get into the museum.

Tariq: The museum? ... But Troy told me someone would come to help. She promised...

Crane: Okay, Tariq. You tell me how to get into the museum, and maybe I can sort out your problem here, okay?

Tariq: Rais controls the museum. He would kill you on sight.

Crane: Well, then I can't have him see me. Now, Troy said you used to be the curator, and that if anybody would know a way in, it would be you. So, how do I (do) it?

Tariq: Do you have scuba gear, perhaps?

Crane: No.

Tariq: Too bad. There's an entrance under the surface of Emerald Pond, but it would be a long swim under the water. You would most likely drown.

Crane: Well, most likely isn't definitely, so I guess I'll give it a try.

====Underwater entrance to the museum====
Crane: Oh, God, my lungs...

Crane: Troy?

Troy: I hear you.

Crane: I'm in.

Troy: That was the easiest part of this. You realize that, right?

Crane: You really suck at pep talks, Troy.

Troy: Not my job... But good luck.

====Museum====
(Rais' soldier: Sshh! Quiet! I've heard something.)

Crane: Oh, sh*t...

Rais: We meet again. The last time we met you took something of mine, now I took something of yours.

Crane: I don't negotiate with *ssholes, Rais. I get out of here with Jade or I take your other hand too. Your choice.

Rais: You cannot simply DEMAND to have her, Crane. You must make a showing of EFFORT first.

Tahir: ATTACK!

(Rais' soldier: Move it, boys! Move it!)

Crane: Is that the best you've got, Rais!? I could this all f*ck*ng day!

Rais: Poor Jade... she's so lonely without you...

Rais: She's waiting for you... Come and get her...

(Crane: No! Not this again!)

Rais: Find her, Crane. Come on... She won't wait for you forever...

Rais: Crane, Crane, Crane... Jade's dying to see you.

Rais: She's running out of time. Hurry up, Crane.

Rais: Come on, Crane... Try harder! You get her too late, and there won't be much left of her...

====Jade's demise====
Crane: JADE! Oh sh*t... oh sh*t, what have they done to you...

Jade: I'm... fine, Crane. Tahir knocked me over the head before he dumped me in here. Just... give me a minute, I'll be right as rain.

Rais: You do not have the luxury of a minute, "Scorpion".

Rais: In fact, what little time you have, you owe to me. Thanks to your repair of my antennas, Crane, I have listened to every word any of you have said.

Rais: How do you suppose I found you, Ms. Aldemir? Or the good Dr. Camden? How do you think I broke the connection between the sectors?

Rais: I am the director of this film. And now that I have Zere's research... the GRE will do as I COMMAND them.

Rais: Which renders the two of you useless. Tahir!

Rais: You took offense, Crane, as I recall, at being referred to as a trained monkey.

Rais: But look at you now. Dancing. For our amusement.

Rais: You are strong enough to have joined me. But you lack the proper... character.

Rais: Consider this a character-strengthening exercise.

Crane: Come on, Jade! Let's get out of here!

Crane: Oh, Jade, are... Jade! Are you hurt? They didn't bite you, did they?

Jade: I'm fine! I'm fine. Just... give me a second.

Rais: Sweet little Jade is far from "fine", Crane. She was bitten and infected hours ago. How noble of her to try and hide it from you.

Jade: Biter got me on the leg. You didn't need to know.

Rais: Once again you find yourself with a choice, Crane.

Rais: Your precious Scorpion is about to turn... but so are you.

Rais: Who will receive the Antizin? Who has a hope of living through this encounter? It's up to you now.

Crane: Jade... here, you take this.

Jade: No.

Crane: No, come on! Listen! I've still got some in my system - you need this worse than I do!

Jade: Crane... I just want you to promise me one thing.

Jade: When the time comes, you're the one who takes me out.

Crane: What?! No... I...

Jade: PROMISE ME!

Crane: (What?) Jade. I can't-

Jade: Crane! Crane, can you hear me?

Crane: Jade, where are you?

Crane: Jade!

Jade: I need you to hear me, Crane!

Jade: I know you wanted to try and save me. Not everybody would've offered that vial the way you did.

Jade: But it's too late for that now. It's too late for me.

Jade: For a while I blamed you for Amir's death, I wanted to kill you.

Jade: But I realized... it was time for Amir. It was time for him to go.

(Boy: Zombie! Run!)

Jade: Everybody's life is finite, Crane. You can't deny it. It's pointless.

Jade: We get here, and eventually we die, and there's nothing we can do to change that.

(Crane: Sh*t! My hand!)

(Brecken: There were kids in there!)

(Crane: No! Not again!)

Jade: The only thing we can do is make what happens in between COUNT.

(Zere: Crane. Save these people...)

Jade: Amir's life counted. And now he's gone. Rahim's life counted. And now HE'S gone.

Jade: If sacrificing my life means saving everyone in Harran... then that's what I want to do.

(Crane: Sh*t! My hand!)

Jade: Don't take that away from me, Crane.

Jade: I was born premature. The doctors didn't think I was going to live.

Jade: But I fought. I struggled, and I fought, and I worked, and worked, and worked.

Jade: I became a champion. I became the Scorpion. I left my mark on the world.

Jade: It's my time now, Crane. You can't save me. You've got to let me save you. Let me save you.

(Amir: GET THE DOOR OPEN!)

Crane: No... God d*mn it, NO... don't make me do this!

Crane: Oh no-oh God, Jade, what was I... I'm so sorry, I-I didn't mean to...

Jade: One of us has to live, Kyle... You just remember what you promised me.

Rais: All of this, and still you had your choice made for you. Disappointing, Crane.

Rais: You, you, you and you. Get in there and kill them.

Rais: THAT is the natural order of things, Crane. Kill or be killed. Eat or be eaten.

Crane: Goodbye, Jade.

====Tahir====
Rais: Tahir! Kill that son of a b*tch!

Tahir: You Americans don't know when to quit, do you?

Tahir: Nothing you do will make a bit of difference!

Tahir: It's too late!

Tahir: Your whole world's about to turn to sh*t!

Tahir: And there's nothing you can do to stop it!

Tahir: You can't win! Why can't you understand that?!

Crane: Where is Rais?!

Tahir: You will never know, boy.

Crane: Tell me where he's going!!

Tahir: It is not for you to seek out Rais!

Tahir: When he wants you, he will find you himself!

Tahir: I can see this kind of talk pains you. Don't worry! The pain will soon be over!

Tahir: Time to die, boy!

Crane: Look at that. Jade lost her life for this thing, it's just lying on the floor.

Crane: I guess Rais must've dropped it when he was trying not to get shot, huh?

Crane: Sh*t... this is just the tissue samples. Where's the other package?

Tahir: Go to... hell... Crane.

Crane: Wow, Tahir. You're looking pretty f*ck*d up, huh? Yeah, those don't look like the kinds of wounds you recover from.

Tahir: So? Then... kill me.

Crane: No, no... I shouldn't. I should just leave you here to suffer. That's what you deserve.

Tahir: Yes? ... Then why don't you?

Crane: Because you're not the kind of loose end you leave untied.

Crane: Troy, it's Crane.

Troy: Crane? You're alive!

Crane: Troy... Jade's dead.

Troy: Oh... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Crane, I mean it. What happened?

Crane: Rais... he... he forced us to...

Crane: Jade saved my life, Troy. Again. She died... saving me.

Troy: Crane... you've still got to call off the Ministry. That's why Jade sacrificed herself. So you could do this.

Troy: So you could save the rest of us.

Crane: Is Savvy there? Has he figured out how to get a message through?

Troy: Yes, but to do it you need to meet me.

Troy: I have to give you an amplifier, that Savvy says can help us break through the signal jamming.

Troy: I'll wait for you in the safe zone, halfway to the antenna, where you'll need to mount the amp.

Crane: Okay, Troy. On my way.

====Old Town====
Crane: Dr. Camden? It's Crane. Do you copy?

Camden: Crane, good to hear you're still alive. Did you find Jade?

Crane: Yeah... yeah. I found her.

Crane: Listen, I also found Dr. Zere's tissue samples. And I'll bring them to you, but first there's something else I need to do.

Camden: Okay, Crane, but remember we don't have a lot of time.

Crane: I know, Doc. I'm about to BUY us time. I'll be in touch.

Troy: Crane! Here is the amp.

Crane: So. What do I have to do?

Troy: You need to install it at the highest place possible. That way we'll have the best chance to break through.

Crane: Okay. So let me guess - I need to head out to that giant antenna tower at the edge of town?

Troy: The fastest way is through the sewers. Savvy'll guide you over the radio, so contact him when you get to the other side.

Troy: And Crane... When you install the amp, make sure to set the correct frequency on your radio. Pull this off and the entire world will hear you.

Crane: Let's hope so. See you, Troy.

===Broadcast===
Crane: F*ck... is that a kid? No way...

Crane: Didn't shut it up fast enough... sh*t.

Crane: Okay... how to get from here... to up there...

Crane: Gotta find a ledge or something.

Crane: Beautiful weather...

Crane: This must be the place.

Crane: One day I'm gonna do this and end up landing on a bag of rusty knives, I just know it.

Crane: Savvy? You there?

Savvy: Yeah, man! You okay?

Crane: I'm above ground and still in one piece.

Savvy: Oh, good. Now listen... you'll need the key card to the substation. Otherwise there'll be no power to the antenna.

Crane: Okay. Where do I get this card?

Savvy: You'll have to search the containers. It'll be in one of them.

Crane: I'll have to SEARCH the place? You mean the card might not even be here?

Savvy: No, no, it's there, mate! It's just - the last guy who tried to do something like this made it to one of the containers before we, uh... lost contact with him...

Crane: Great. Nothing.

Crane: Holy sh*t.

Crane: Worst. Bridge. Ever.

Crane: Sh*t... These f*ck*rs again...

Crane: YES! F*ck*ng FINALLY!

Crane: Got it! Savvy, I got the key card!

Savvy: Great! Now go to the substation. It's close to the antenna mast, inside the fence. Use the card to get inside.

Crane: Eucchh... the exploding ones. F*ck*ng perfect.

Crane: Savvy! I'm in!

Savvy: Okay, good! Turn on the transformer!

Crane: Holy sh*t!

Crane: Done.

Savvy: Awesome. Now find the control panel at the base of the mast and turn it on.

Savvy: Just get to the top of the mast and install the amplifier! It'll turn every radio within a hundred meters into a powerhouse!

Crane: Yeah. Just get to the top. No sweat.

Crane: Oh sh*t, the cable snapped!

Crane: YOU'VE GOT TO BE F*CK*NG KIDDING ME!

Savvy: Crane, remember to set the frequency on your radio, when you mount the amp.

Crane: (Yeah.) Yeah... got it.

Crane: Of course it waits till I'm all the way up here to stop raining.

Crane: Anyone who can hear me, please listen! My name is Kyle Crane, and I'm sending this message from inside the Harran quarantine!

Crane: Colonel Taner and the Ministry of Defense have lied to you! There are still survivors inside the walls!

Crane: They plan to firebomb Harran, but if those bombs drop, you will know Taner and the Ministry are cold-blooded murderers!

Radio Voice: Holy sh*t... there's someone alive in the quarantine zone...

Radio Voice: Hey, do you copy? ... copy? It's...

Radio Voice: I knew it... I knew it!

Crane: Oh, that was too close...

GRE: Crane? Is that you? Do you copy?

Crane: The hell do you want?

GRE: We want to offer you a chance to get out of that horrible place.

Crane: Oh yeah? And why would you do that? I never found out who had your precious file. You don't even have to pay the rest of my fee.

GRE: Water under the bridge, Kyle! We're best off just to move past that.

GRE: All you need to do is (to) bring Dr. Zere's research with you, and we'll send a nice, safe helicopter to extract you.

Crane: ... You realize, I know what was in the file. I know you were going to exploit the virus.

GRE: Crane-

Crane: Oh my GOD. You need the cure now for SPIN, don't you?

Crane: That's the only way you could get out of this - try to convince everyone you were working toward a cure the whole time!

GRE: Don't be ridiculous, Crane. Bring us the research and everything will be fine.

Crane: You want the research? Then just f*ck*ng wait for my signal.

Crane: Savvy, you there? The amplifier's installed!

Savvy: Brilliant, Crane! Now just zipline down - that tunnel I mentioned is near where you'll land.

Crane: F*ck! No no NO!

Crane: Yeah, nothing can go wrong with this plan...

====Old Town====
Crane: YES!

Crane: Dr. Camden? This is Kyle Crane. Can you hear me?

Camden: I can hear you. Are you on your way? I'm ready to work, just bring me the samples.

Crane: That's exactly what I intend to do, Doc.

Camden: Just remember... I'm surrounded by an army of infected.

Crane: Affirmative. Expect me soon.

Camden: Good. Not like I'm going anywhere.

===The Clinic===
Camden: You must be Crane. I can see you through the security cameras.

Crane: That's me. Name's Crane.

Camden: Use the elevator. Push the button for the bottom floor.

Crane: Got it.

====Camden's lab====
Camden: I was sad to hear about Dr. Zere. He and I were thrilled to get the chance to study the Harran Virus...

Camden: Not to mention, the GRE paid us quite handsomely.

Camden: (Oh.) By the way, we're on backup power now, so we have minimal functionality.

Camden: I needed extra power for my last experiment and the generators overheated and shut down.

Camden: I hope you don't mind me reminiscing out loud like this.

Camden: It's been quite a number of weeks since I've had the prospect of talking to an actual live human, in person.

Camden: Oh - and the door leading to the main corridor can only be opened manually.

Camden: You'll have to get to the security room and throw the switch.

Crane: On my way.

Camden: All right, now go down the main corridor. The lab is on the left.

Camden: When the outbreak happened, Zere and I stayed in the quarantine to work on the cure.

Camden: You know who was supposed to protect us? Kadir Suleiman! Rais himself!

Camden: THAT worked out just perfectly.

Camden: Okay. The only way into the lab is through the decontamination room. The entrance is to the right.

Camden: Everything went straight to hell after Rais's brother died, you know.

Camden: Rais went from a guy with monstrous tendencies to a full-blown monster.

Camden: You'll have to run the decontamination protocol to unlock the doors.

Camden: It won't work without full power, though. That's where the generators come in.

Camden: Head to the offices. Once you're there, I'll point you in the right direction.

Crane: All right, I'm on it...

Camden: Zere and I got to safety with the help of a GRE operative - a man very similar to you...

Camden: The operative who helped us was supposed to evacuate alongside us... but you can guess how well that worked out, since Zere and I both got stuck here.

Camden: Be extra careful, now - I never cleared the Infected from that part of the facility, as I've never had a reason to go in there.

Camden: I got separated from the two of them, but I made it here, to this clinic. I really had no other option than to work on finding a cure.

Camden: Watch it - I'm opening the door.

Camden: Zere and the operative fell in with Brecken's crowd. I guess I would have as well, if I'd been able to get to them.

Camden: Hmm... I'm sorry about this, but the only way to get to the generator room is through the ventilation shafts.

Camden: The shafts lead to the stockroom. From there you can reach the hallway and then the generators.

Crane: Man, I hope two is enough...

Camden: Good job. Now head back to the decontamination room.

Camden: You know, I suspect, even if Zere had been able to leave the quarantine, he wouldn't have.

Camden: He and the operative both felt the need to stay and help people.

Camden: Push the button by the door to begin the process.

Camden: All right. Now you can come in.

Camden: Crane, glad to be finally shaking hands with you. Now, let's have those tissue samples, shall we?

Crane: Doc... mind if I show you a photo?

Camden: No, no, no... just, just, just... one minute.

Camden: All right. We'll just let that run. That's gonna take quite a while. Now, what was it you wanted to say?

Camden: Hey! That's him! That's the GRE operative I was telling you about! What's his name?

Crane: Amir.

Camden: Yes! YES! Amir Ghoreyshi! ... What are you doing with a picture of him?

Crane: We, uh... had a mutual friend.

Camden: The samples are still viable. That's good. With some luck, your trip here won't have been for nothing.

Camden: Where is the rest of the data, by the way? I know Zere prepared two packages.

Crane: I'll have to get back to you on that, Doc. Right now I have some GRE sh*theads to confront.

Camden: GRE? ... Crane, you watch yourself around them. Their public face is a lie of epic proportions. Those people are all heartless, lying b*st*rds.

Crane: I hear you, Doc. And thanks, I'll be in touch.

====Old Town====
Camden: Listen, Crane, I've got to reiterate: you'd better watch your back, your front, and both sides with those GRE b*st*rds. They'll screw you if they get the chance.

Crane: I know, Doc. I'll be careful. I just need to figure out where things stand.

Crane: Troy? I gave the samples to Dr. Camden. Now I'm gonna have a little talk with the GRE.

Troy: And what are you going to tell them?

Crane: Everything... I'll meet you later, Troy.

Crane: This is Crane. Do you copy?

Rais: Kyle Crane. You can hear me, can you not?

Crane: Rais! Where are you?

Rais: Exactly where I should be - atop my own Tower. Of course, mine is not quite complete...

Rais: ...but it still stands as a monument to chaos... to entropy. To what it means to be ruled only by oneself.

Crane: I'll kill you. For what you did to Jade... for EVERYTHING. I'll f*ck*ng KILL YOU.

Rais: I had hoped that would be your attitude. You see, we are at war, you and I.

Rais: A war of opposing philosophies. A war to see whose vision of the world proves true.

Rais: Come, Crane. Come and challenge me. What is it you Americans are so fond of saying... ? "I dare you."

Crane: You know what? ... Forget it. There's no "war". There's only your f*ck*d-up outlook. Go to hell.

Rais: Oh, no, I won't be going to hell. I will be leaving Harran, though.

Rais: You see, I have made a deal with our GRE brothers. Using your very own communicator, no less.

Rais: They know I have all of Dr. Zere's research data.

Rais: They called it "the keys to the kingdom". Very shortly a helicopter will come and take me away.

Rais: Imagine the damage I shall be able to do, outside the confines of these walls! Of course, if you think you can stop me...

Crane: You crazy son of a B*TCH.

Rais: THAT is what I had hoped to hear. Come and find me, Crane. Let us finish what we began.

===Extraction===
Crane: Oh sh*t... what the hell... ?

Rais: I knew you could not resist, Crane.

Crane: Would you just shut up? You're the last thing I want to hear.

Rais: What? HEAR me? What a brilliant idea!

Rais: There... much better. It is fitting than an orchestra plays when kings clash.

Rais: THERE... the agents of my will!

Rais: Run, Crane, run. It's what you slaves are good at, right? Run or die!

Rais: Quite an entrance. Perhaps you ARE a king... a king of MUD.

Rais: Here, Crane...

Rais: ... accept an offering to the king!

Rais: You cannot kill me. You cannot defeat me.

Rais: You cannot even REACH me.

Rais: And yet you try and try. Let me offer you a bit of accompaniment.

Rais: The music of SUFFERING. Played by slaves... perfect for a slave!

Rais: Come on, come on... faster, goddammit...

Karim: Crane. Rais said you would come...

Crane: You've been shot! What the f*ck is going on?

Karim: This is... what we get for... trying to make a living.

Karim: Rais... betrayed us all.

Crane: Yeah, I'm on my way up there, Karim. I'm going to kill that motherf*ck*r with my bare hands.

Karim: Not... this way. We've laid mines on the... two floors above us... Go through the second block... As high as you can... Then... you can come back...

Crane: Goodbye, Karim.

Crane: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

Rais: Hmmm. Karim managed to warn you, did he not? I was right to shoot him.

Rais: Some might think it unsporting of me, taking aim at you like this.

Crane: I liked you better when you didn't talk so d*mn much...

Rais: But I consider it a matter of... let us call it "leveling the playing field". That is a term you can understand, yes?

Rais: You sound as if that hurt, Crane.

Rais: Allow me to add to your suffering!

Rais: I cast the deciding vote, Crane.

Rais: Consider yourself expelled!

Rais: Do you know how many men have bested me in a fight before, Crane?

Rais: None. No one. NEVER.

Rais: Consider yourself a member of an exclusive club.

Crane: Where are you hiding, you f*ck*r!?

Rais: Sad for you, it is a club I mean to disband.

Rais: Poor Crane! So consumed with emotion.

Rais: Burning with the need for revenge...

Rais: Eaten alive by hatred.

Rais: Such feelings make you WEAK.

====Rais' demise====
Rais: So... face to face again. I guess that means I don't need this anymore...

Crane: With or without it, Suleiman, you're dead.

Rais: Come now, Crane. Do not pretend you don't care. How many lives depend on this disc? Hundreds? Thousands? ... Perhaps BILLIONS?

Rais: You are right about one thing, Crane...

Rais: ... Suleiman is dead!

Rais: He died with his brother. In this city.

Rais: You don't even belong here. You don't know what suffering is.

Rais: I will teach you, Crane... you will suffer alongside me!

Rais: Yes... Go on... You cannot resist... Do it. I won't fight you. Just as you killed Tahir - DO IT.

Crane: F*ck you, *sshole. You want me to make my own rules? Here's rule #1: you're gonna spend the rest of your godd*mn life in f*ck*ng agony.

Rais: Do not... leave me like this, Crane.

Rais: Prove you are a man. Take your vengeance!

Crane: God, will you just SHUT THE F*CK UP!

(Rais: Crane!)

Rais: How the tables have turned... in the blink of an eye. If I were trapped in Harran, this wound would have killed me.

Rais: But now YOU dangle on the edge of life and death, while the GRE wait to take ME to a hospital.

Rais: I give you... the HONOR... of deciding your own fate. Hand me the disc... so that there is at least a CHANCE that Harran might live... and I will make your death painless.

Rais: Or resist, and doom the city along with you. You have until the count of five.

Rais: One... two... 

Crane: All right! All right! Here!

Crane: How's THAT for a decision? *sshole.

Crane: What do you want?

GRE: Rais already told us he had that dead scientist's data. All we're interested in is the cure. We're offering you a chance, here!

GRE: Get the rest of the research and come with us!

Crane: I can think of a lot of reasons to tell you to go f*ck yourself, but why don't we pretend for a minute that you DON'T think I'm stupid?

Crane: You need the cure. It's here, in the city... somewhere. And as long as it is, you won't try to pull any Ministry-style b*llsh*t.

GRE: Crane, why do you even GIVE a f*ck what happens to these people? You don't belong here! This is just a job for you!

Crane: (No.) Not anymore, it's not... I'll be in touch when I've decided what to do next.

Camden: Crane? Can you hear me? It's Camden!

Crane: Yeah, I hear you. What's going on, Doc?

Camden: The analysis just finished on the tissue samples! The results are... well, I don't think the word "phenomenal" is too strong!

Camden: Crane, if you can recover Zere's data, I'm CERTAIN a cure is within reach!

Crane: All right.

Crane: We'll talk about it next time I see you.

==Side Quests (Slums)==

===A Baby is Born===
Crane: What was that?!

Crane: Hey, open up in there!

Macary: Who are you?

Crane: Crane, from the Tower. I heard a woman screaming.

Macary: Uhh... yeah... it's my wife. She's... uh... giving birth.

Crane: Oh, sh*t. Is there anything I can do?

Macary: We need alcohol... To disinfect. Please, help us!

Crane: Alcohol? Hmm...

====Turning in multiple sets of alcohol====
Crane: Hey! I've got some alcohol!

Macary: Thank you, this is going to be a big help ... But is that all you could find? It's not really enough.

Macary: I'd go out myself, but I can't leave my wife now.

Crane: Let me see if I can find some more.

Crane: Hey! It's Crane! I've found some more.

Macary: Yerre'ere... Great, cause we're going through it like water.

Macary: But... uh... Is that it? It's almost enough, but not quite.

Crane: You must have a lot of germs in there.

Macary: With this terrible plague, everything has to be clean. Spotless. I can't risk my newborn getting infected.

Macary: We must have more alcohol.

Crane: The disease is actually transferred from a bite, that causes...

Crane: Hey! I've got the alcohol! Everything okay in there?

Macary: (Oh!) Ya gots more?

Crane: Uhh... yeah, here.

Macary: Cheers... buhye...

Crane: (Uhh...) I could let it go, but I don't think I'm going to.

Crane: Of course.

Crane: Great... (*ssh*les.)

===A Survivor's Guide to Zombieland===
Neil: I'm Neil Fallon. I'm a journalist for International Affairs Magazine.

Crane: Yeah, I've heard of you.

Neil: You have?

Crane: How the hell did you get in here?

Neil: It wasn't so hard during the first few days of the quarantine. And when they put Suleiman in charge, it was pretty clear how things were going to go.

Crane: So you decided to stick around.

Neil: Actually, I've decided to leave, though God knows how that's going to happen.

Neil: I've been in some lock-down cities before, but there's usually someone you can bribe. Not here.

Crane: I can't get you out of Harran. I'm not sure anyone can.

Neil: No, of course. But I've been documenting this place, pretty much from day one. I've interviewed hundreds of.. Well, people who aren't people any more.

Neil: Suleiman has a lot to answer for. The world needs to know what's happened and...

Neil: Look, I'm kind of desperate here. I've lost my work. All of it.

Neil: I was holed up at an internet cafe, when a mob of Infected landed on me. I got out without a bite, but I left my satchel at the cafe.

Crane: And everything's in the satchel?

Neil: Most of it. They chased me for a while, so I finally had to ditch my camera in a car.

Neil: Look, I know it's a lot to ask...

Crane: Even if I recovered them, you still don't have a way out of here.

Neil: Mister, if I can't get my work back, there's no reason for me to get out.

Crane: That cafe is in a bad area. I'll think about it, but no promises, okay?

====Getting the items====
Crane: Fallon, it's me. I'm near the cafe. Anything I should know?

Neil: Stay clear of the latte. They tend to burn the milk.

Crane: (Alright.) I've got your satchel. Now, where's the camera?

Neil: My God, you're incredible! It's in the trunk of a black car on the Infamy Bridge.

Crane: That's not what I was hoping you'd say.

Crane: Oh, crap!

Crane: No-no-no-no-no... Dammit!

Neil: You did it! I can't even begin to thank you enough. What's your name? People are going to know about you.

Crane: My name doesn't matter, 'cause you're still not getting out of here. No one's getting out of here.

Neil: But... then why'd you do it? Why risk your life like that?

Crane: I thought you deserved a chance to prove me wrong. Good luck, Fallon.

Neil: Yeah. Thanks. You too.

===Assault and Batteries===
Tolga: Attention! Attention! Since you cannot hear dog whistles, we are forced to communicate with you directly. You are ordered to come immediately.

Crane: This is Crane. Is that you, Tolga?

Fatin: Ehh! He wants to talk to us.

Tolga: Well, I don't want to talk to him.

Tolga: I repeat, you are ordered to come immediately. That is all.

Fatin: Shut off the radio.

Tolga: Right!

====Harran Public School====
(Fatin: Here he comes!)

(Tolga: We must avoid technical terms. Keep the concepts simple.)

(Fatin: Ahh, yes! We don't want to break it. Should we smile? To what purpose? Looking ridiculous?)

Crane: Hey boys. What are we into this time?

Tolga: Do you understand what a battery is?

Fatin: Tolga, you're overwhelming hiim!

Fatin: Inside the engine compartment of a bus is a heavy rectangle.

Crane: I know what a battery is.

Fatin: (Okay.) We need bus batteries, with marine grade plates, and rated at 1300 CCA or better.

Tolga: CCA means Cold Cranking Amps.

Fatin: Obviously.

Crane: That's a pretty big battery.

Tolga: Yes, easily 50-55 kilograms each.

Fatin: That's equal to several large rocks.

Fatin: He's American. The metric system makes him angry.

Tolga: We will need three of them.

Fatin: You can use your brute strength. We know you primitives are keen to show how strong you are, to demonstrate physical prowess.

Tolga: You think it will attract females.

Fatin: Ugly and stupid, what else does he have?

Tolga: How does he live like that?

Fatin: Who knows?

Fatin: You have your instructions. Go do your... "interpretation" of them.

====After getting the bus batteries====
Crane: Here are your batteries.

Tolga: Better check them for bite marks.

Tolga: Well done!

Fatin: No problems with the counting part of the mission?

Crane: How much more do you need to do on this project of yours?

Fatin: None of your business. Good bye.

===Bandages and Meds===
Toygar: Bandages! Awesome! People love bandages - at least the ones who need them do. Other people don't really care so much.

Toygar: But the guy who lives across the hall from me just shot off his thumb, so he's REALLY gonna appreciate this stuff.

Toygar: Say, you didn't see any loose thumbs out there, did you? When he shot it off, it kind of flew out the window.

Toygar: It would look like a chicken nugget with a bullet hole. No? Well, keep your eyes open.

===Binoculars===
Santiago: Oh, you've found binoculars! Great, they will come in handy for sure.

Santiago: Here's your reward. Not too much, but... I can also show you a glass-eye trick! (Oh!) Not interested? Whatever...

===Bring Me the Brain of Usain Bolter===
Crane: This isn't good. This is not good at all.

Crane: I'll give her one more chance.

Dahlia: I merely will your presence and you are here within minutes. Perfect!

Crane: Dahlia, the elixirs are working, but I need one with no side-effects.

Dahlia: And you shall have it. But how quickly you have adapted. This would not be possible if you had not already been bitten. You are closer to them than you think.

Crane: I'm taking care of it.

Dahlia: With your Antizin. Such a feeble mixture.

Crane: Just tell me what I need to bring you.

Dahlia: I will put my thought into your mind.

Crane: You don't control me, Dahlia.

Dahlia: No. Of course. I am just a foolish old woman. Now think and tell me what you believe I will need.

Crane: It's not hard to guess. Your distillations effect the pattern recognition processes of the "immortui". So, now I assume you'll want a brain. Probably from one of the stronger ones.

Dahlia: Yes?

Crane: From a Bolter.

Dahlia: And you simply guessed this? Well, if it gives you some comfort, so be it.

Dahlia: Now go.

Dahlia: Return when you have what I need.

====Returning to Dahlia====
Dahlia: The brain of a bolter! Excellent!

Dahlia: Take it. It is the most powerful elixir I can make for you.

===Cease and Desist===
Blake: The scouts have seen people entering the school. Something's going on there.

Derek: Somebody's in the school. Our scouts spotted people entering the building.

Mesut: I saw some people in the school. Gotta wonder what they were doing there.

====Harran Public School====
Edward: Freeze!

Crane: I just want to talk.

Edward: Try listening. The first bullet goes over your head. The next one goes through it.

Erol: Stop it, Edward! You don't want to scare off someone who might be willing to help us!

Edward: We don't know this *sshole from a plate of falafel.

Erol: Don't argue with me! Let him in!

Edward: Seems Erol wants to talk to you.

Crane: There won't be any trouble.

Erol: Do I look worried?

Crane: Scared to death.

Erol: He's perceptive. Come in, come in!

Erol: I'm Erol.

Crane: Kyle Crane.

Erol: This is my niece, Saliha, and her son, Eren. Do forgive Edward, but he's completely right to be worried. We're being pursued by some very ruthless men.

Crane: There's something oddly familiar about you.

Erol: There should be. The campaign spent a lot of money putting my face all over town.

Crane: Of course. You're Erol Asani, Governor of the Province.

Erol: Governor of nothing... but Rais has decided that any political figure is a threat to him, so he's ordered my execution.

Erol: They nearly killed me once already. That's how I lost my leg.

Erol: ...and it seems they haven't given up.

Erol: A squad of his thugs has tracked me to my last safe house in the Slabs.

Edward was just there.

Erol: He says they're searching the area. It's only a matter of time before they show up here.

Crane: Sounds like you've got quite a problem.

Erol: I would pay you very well to resolve it.

Crane: You know, people say that a lot to me.

Erol: Trust me. What I can offer you can't be found anywhere else, at any price.

Crane: I'll think about it.

====At the Slabs====
Karim: Ozan! Where the hell are you? (Talk to me!)

Crane: That's Karim on the radio.

Karim: Hamdi, answer me! What's going on out there?!

Karim: What's wrong with you? Report your position!

Karim: Have you found him or not?

Karim: Firat, report! What is your status?!

Karim: Erol must be somewhere nearby! I want him alive!

Karim: Ozan! Where the hell are you? You'd better not be screwing around!

Karim: You get lost? Get your asses back here, then. Gabriel's Estate 5. Come in through the basement.

Karim: Is that you, Ozan?

Rais's Soldier: We cut power to the lift, Karim! Just in case!

Crane: Karim, it's Crane. Drop your weapon or you're dead.

Karim: What the hell's your problem? This doesn't concern you!

Crane: Sorry, Karim, but Erol Asani is my concern.

Karim: You're working for him? You're a fool!

Karim: I was his bodyguard. Okay? After everything got f*ck*d up and they built the wall, we got overrun. He got bitten on the leg...

Karim: I took him to Randall, the only doctor I knew in the Slums... and we cut it off. Clean.

Karim: It was the only way... he would've turned if we hadn't done it. But the stubborn b*st*rd never forgave us. So, we parted ways.

Crane: So why are you trying to track him down now?

Karim: Early on, the authorities evac'ed all the political bigwigs out of the zone. Erol told us there was a chopper on the way to take us out with him.

Karim: Then he got bitten, and with all the sh*t that happened after that, we missed the flight.

Karim: But after you turned on the transmitter, we heard Erol asking for evac. And a couple of days ago somebody responded... from outside!

Karim: The old b*st*rd's got a flight out, and I want a seat on it.

Crane: What about Rais? Does he care about this guy?

Karim: Not a rat's ass. This was my business. I just want to get out of Harran.

Crane: Well, it looks like you won't be making that flight, huh?

Karim: That had already dawned on me. But I'd like to walk out of here.

Crane: Look, if I see you again, I'm going to assume the worst. You got it?

Karim: Fair enough. Good luck, Crane. You're going to need it.

====Back to Erol====
Erol: Did you find them?

Crane: Yeah, I did. Karim's take on losing your leg was a bit different than yours.

Erol: So you talked to him. Edward was right, you do talk too much. You should leave the talking to people like me, and I'll leave the killing to people like you.

Erol: However... Karim was my bodyguard. He allowed me to get bitten, but I don't really blame him for that.

Crane: Hey! He saved your life!

Erol: By hacking off my leg?! The morning I was bitten was (the) same day they began dropping suppressants.

Erol: You understand? I told him, the Antizin drops would begin within hours. All they had to do was wait.

Erol: Instead, he listened to that idiot doctor of his, and Karim held me down as the butcher chopped off my leg.

Erol: Now he thinks I should fly him out of here.

Crane: I told him that's not going to happen.

Erol: You should have killed him.

Crane: How about you leave the killing to people like me. (Huh?)

Erol: Quite right. I can get you out of here, Crane.

Crane: Maybe I like it here.

Erol: More likely you've made your own arrangements. Well, they won't work. You've been bitten. I can see it in your eyes. You'll never get past the NCOR quarantine.

Crane: Past what?

Erol: You see? You have no idea what's going on in the real world. Whoever you think you know, they're not political, and that's the only thing that's going to work now.

Erol: You don't believe me? Then think of it as an ace up your sleeve. A backup plan.

Erol: In case you haven't noticed, things don't always work out the way they're supposed to in this town.

Crane: If I'm interested, what happens next?

Erol: Two things. The first, is we need to paint some markers on the rooftop. There's no paint around here, so you'll have to go out and find some.

Erol: And the second thing is... Well, let's just say you'll be leaving here in a better way than when you arrived.

Erol: Now go find some paint.

Erol: There's a construction site nearby. You should look there.

Erol: I'll tell the next task when you've completed the first.

Erol: Trust me. You're going to be very satisfied with the outcome.

====After painting the roof====
Crane: Alright, the roof's been painted.

Erol: Good. Now, there is one last thing. There's a duffle bag in a locker on the second floor. I'd like you to bring it to me.

Erol: Since you'll probably open it, there's no point trying to hide the fact that there's 24.7 million dollars inside it. One third of it is yours if you can bring it back.

Crane: Why doesn't Edward get it?

Erol: There are too many biters there. I can't risk losing him. We'd be completely defenseless.

Crane: And this money is yours?

Erol: Most of the bank's depositors are no longer human. Stealing from them isn't a crime, or have you never once taken the wallet off a biter that you've beaten to death?

Crane: (Okay.) I'll recover the bag. But there's no calling in the evac until I say so. When I bring back the money, I'm taking the radio.

Erol: THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!

Crane: But you'll accept it anyway, because you have no choice.

Erol: You're worse than Karim... Very well. I accept your terms.

====Inside the school====
Crane: Empty. Of course.

Erol: Sorry, Crane. I had no choice.

Crane: Karim said I was a fool to trust you.

Erol: It's not what you think. I would have taken you with me.

Erol: I contacted the evac when you were off getting the paint. I had to tell who would be on board, so I gave them your name.

Erol: Now, I don't know who you are, but they knew, and they said you were a no go.

Erol: So I had to send you on that phony money run. There is no money-at least none worth mentioning.

Erol: I'm sorry, Crane. But I've got to get my family out of here.

Erol: Go to the rooftop, and you'll find some things you can use.

Erol: It's not what I promised, but it's the best I can do. Thank you for what you did for us, Crane. Good luck.

====Rooftops====
Karim: Hello, Crane. How's your day been?

Crane: I thought we had an understanding.

Karim: I think we have a better understanding now. But... if you want to shoot me.

Crane: Another time, maybe.

Karim: He did leave you a few goodies. I was going to nick 'em, but I thought, no, Crane's earned 'em. Let him have them.

Crane: You're almost okay, Karim.

Karim: (Heh.) Almost... Until next time.

Crane: Good luck, Karim.

Karim: Exactly.

===Coffee===
Toygar: You are a lifesaver. Those coffee nuts are dangerous. They're basically volatiles that can talk... and they only talk about one thing.

===Crayons for the Kids===
Kate: You found some crayons? Fantastic! You're the best! The kids are gonna lose their minds! ... But in a good way.

Kate: Here, take this. You'll make better use of it than I will.

===Dulse===
Sophia: Thank you, so much! Thank you, so much! Please, take this.

Sophia: My own recipe: it disinfects, improves coagulation and boosts wound healing process.

===Electronic Parts===
Toygar: Rahim's electronic parts? Don't expect the radios to work any better. The truth is Rahim is trying to build a "Robot Runner". He gets these crazy ideas in his head.

===Firebug===
Crane: (Hey!) You want to try calming down long enough to tell me what's wrong?

Zaid: Yeah, sure. Let's try that! Calming down will work! (Yeah!) Calming down will solve everything!

Crane: No, walking away from you will solve everything.

Zaid: Okay, okay! Hang on! I'm chill. I'm chill, bro!

Zaid: So, I make these flares for Rais. Right?

Crane: Flares. Like signal flares?

Zaid: No! No! U.V. Flares! Like, flares that the night things can't stand, because they put out this U-V, which stands for Ultra Violet, which is like.. kind of a science thing.

Crane: Got it. UV flares. Continue.

Zaid: There is no continue! My zinc is contaminated with fluorine. It's useless!

Zaid: Also, I'm out of turpentine, which isn't that hard to find, except... everything's hard to find right now.

Crane: So, when Rais's people come for their merchandise...

Zaid: (Oh!) Is he using people now? I thought he only used hired psychopathic gorillas.

Crane: What do you need to make these things?

Zaid: Just zinc and turpentine, bro. I got the rest.

Zaid: Worst part is, everything I need is in the trainyard warehouses, but a guy like me isn't going to last 10 seconds out there.

Crane: I'm surprised a guy like you has lasted that long in here.

Zaid: Oh, that's very funny... ha, ha... Very funny, funny man...

Crane: Maybe I'll get your supplies, but if I do, whatever you can make out of them, I take half.

Zaid: Half?! No way! You're freakin' nuts, bro!

Crane: (Look.) You can give me half of something, or you can keep 100% of nothing.

Zaid: Half it is! That seems fair.

====After getting the materials====
Zaid: You got 'em?! You got 'em? Let me see!

Zaid: Oh yes! Oh Yes! This is awesome! Zaid gets to live! (Ho ho!)

Zaid: This looks like the beginning of a beautiful ...

Crane: ... We're not friends.

Zaid: No. Of course. My mistake. Associates.

Crane: Not even that. Just tell me how you make them and I'll be on my way.

Zaid: Right. Okie Dokie. Got it. Say no more. We have an understanding. This deal is done.

Crane: Shut up, Zaid.

Zaid: Yes, sir.

===Gas Mask Man===
Crane: Any guess how those Infected got through the fence?

Musa: Guess? I knew exactly how they got in. That masked nut-job sawed through the hasp.

Crane: Who are you talking about?

Musa: They call him Gas Mask Man. He lives outside. He's crazy in the head, so he wears a gas mask all the time like it's going to protect him.

Crane: And you're sure it was him?

Musa: One of the guards saw him cut the hasp and run off.

Musa: Someone's got to do something about that guy.

====Shakur====
Shakur: Stay where you are! Shakur is not taking visitors today.

Crane: If Shakur didn't want visitors, Shakur shouldn't have sabotaged the fence at the fishing camp.

Shakur: What? What are you talking about? That wasn't Shakur! That was Gas Mask Man!

Crane: You're Gas Mask Man.

Shakur: Me? You're insane! Why would you think that?

Crane: Because you're wearing a gas mask.

Shakur: But you have been tricked, my friend! This saboteur was an imposter, who makes himself to look like me, so you will be angry at Shakur! But Shakur knows who did this. Shakur saw him without his mask.

Crane: You're saying you saw someone disguised as you?

Shakur: I watched him from behind the rocks. He did not see Shakur, but Shakur saw him.

Crane: Then Shakur better tell me who it is.

Shakur: No! My information is far too valuable. If you want to know what Shakur knows, then first you will do a thing for me. Then I will tell you.

Crane: We're not negotiating, Shakur.

Shakur: Of course not. Shakur tells you what to do, and you must obey. Now obey, Shakur!

Crane: And what exactly does Shakur want?

Shakur: There's a lake nearby... My treasure bag fell out of the boat and was lost in the water... You must be like a fish and bring it back to me. Go! Be quick!

====After getting the bag====
Crane: Alright, I've got your bag. Why couldn't you get it for yourself?

Shakur: Shakur can't swim.

Shakur: Now, first the bag. Then I tell you who is Shakur imposter.

Crane: Alright.

Crane: Okay, Shakur, tell me what you saw.

Shakur: First, the imposter sneaks out of the village. He is very quiet-like a master spy. Then he puts on a mask.

Shakur: Then he sneaks back to the gate, but now he is very noisy, so the guard will see him. Then he cuts the lock and runs away.

Crane: Did you recognize him?

Shakur: He looked crazy to me. Nothing like Shakur.

Crane: But do you know who he was?

Shakur: Of course. He is one of the fishermen-the one who is disguised as Shakur!

Crane: Right... I'll check it out.

Crane: Buy the way, Shakur, what was in the bag?

Shakur: My air! My precious, clean air! Now, I can breathe again.

====Fishermen's Village====
Crane: How many people have keys to open the gate?

Guard: Just a few; Tom, Gursel or Musa.

Crane: Thanks.

Gursel: What can I do for you, Crane?

Crane: You sabotaged the gate, Gursel. You let the Infected into the village.

Gursel: Me? It was the crackpot in the mask. The guard saw him.

Crane: But someone else saw you.

Gursel: Who? Where is he? Show me.

Crane: There's also the mask I found in your hut.

Gursel: Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do? The village didn't want to pay tribute to Rais, and Rais was getting impatient. That's why he sent you, right?

Crane: So you allowed an attack on your own people?

Gursel: I had to convince them that they need Rais's protection. It did the job, didn't it, so what the hell do you care?

Crane: Now Musa wants to put a bullet in Gas Mask Man.

Gursel: And that's a problem?

Crane: Yeah. Make sure it doesn't happen, or you'll be explaining why you allowed Infected into the village.

Gursel: (Alright.) Alright, I'll talk to Musa and the guard.

Crane: (Alright.) Gas Mask Man won't be bothering you any more.

Musa: Did you put a bullet in him?

Crane: (No.) That wasn't necessary.

Musa: After what he did?!

Crane: (Look.) You may not like it, but murdering people is still kind of (a) big deal. If you decide it isn't, you and me are going to have (some) problems.

Musa: No problems, Mister. I just got mad. I've never hurt anybody. Thanks for talking to him.

===Gassed Up===
Alfie: Heads-up everyone, this is Alfie. We've just lost gas at the Tower, and as far as I can tell the whole city has too.

Crane: Any guess what happened?

Alfie: None, and our gas man Jeff, up and quit on us last week. He was kind of irreplaceable.

Crane: Maybe I can track him down.

Alfie: Make maybe, definitely, and get on it fast. Word is he's built-up his own little fortress somewhere behind the train station.

Jeff: I can see you real clear!

Jeff: Identify yourself, or you will be shot!

Jeff: Go away!

Jeff: This is the Fort Jefferson Tower, and you will address me as Commander Jeff.

Jeff: I make the rules here. Is that clear? Not Brecken, not Rais. This is Jeffville...

Jeff: Or Jeffland... Or Jeffertown... Or New-Jeff-City...

Crane: Look, Jeff...

Jeff: Commander Jeff!

Crane: There's an emergency. The gas is out all over the city.

Jeff: Oh. Yeah. That... That was me.

Crane: You shut off the gas?

Jeff: Installation of The Fort Jefferson Apocalypse Wall required a temporary interruption of the civilian gas supply. But I'm all ready now, so you can turn it back on.

Crane: I think that's going to be your job.

Jeff: No can do. I'm too critical to base operations. We'll have to send someone who's expendable.

Crane: Commander, I'd like to volunteer.

Jeff: You're a good man, whoever you said you are. I hate to lose you.

Jeff: Now, go open the quadrant allocation valves, plus the primary distribution gate. Then report back to me, and I'll restore the city main pressure here.

Jeff: Hey! If you don't get killed, you can be the first civilian to witness my Apocalypse Wall.

(Jeff: I can't wait to see this thing work. People thought I was nuts. Would a nut make a wall of fire?)

====After opening the primary distribution gate====
Jeff: Fire and brimstone! What the hell did you just do?!

Crane: Alright, I opened the local valves, plus the primary gate.

Jeff: Uh-huh. What about the ballast lines?

Crane: (Wait.) The what?

Jeff: Flaming flatulence! Do I have to tell you everything?!

Jeff: Obviously, you have to close all the valves on the Blue Line to keep the pressure balanced.

Jeff: Now hurry up, or we're going to be leaking more gas than grandma at Christmas!

====Closing all Blue Line valves====
Jeff: That did it. Now get back here on the double, soldier.

Crane: Aye-aye, Commander.

Jeff: This ain't the Navy, son. Drink some coffee and sober up.

Jeff: Well done, Soldier. I'll open the main pressure gate. Then prepare your eyes for a feast of controlled pyro-combustion.

Crane: I think I should watch this from a distance.

Jeff: If you insist. You've got 10 seconds.

Jeff: ... Five...

Jeff: ... Four...

Jeff: ... Three...

Jeff: ... Two...

Jeff: .... One...

Jeff: IGNITION!

Jeff: Behold, the satanic inferno of the Apocalypse Wall!

Alfie: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

Crane: I found Jeff, and the gas is back on.

Alfie: That's a relief. Told you, he's irreplaceable.

Crane: (Yeah.) Well, I'm afraid you're going to have to find a replacement.

===Goodnight Mr. Bahir===
Jared: Hey, do you have spare keys for 202?

Crane: What's the problem?

Jared: Something's going on in there, and the door's locked from inside.

Seth: Hey! Could you check on Bahir in 202 and see if he's around? Tell him he's late for his shift and Seth is getting mad. Could you do that for me?

Crane: Sure, if I see him.

(Chris: There it is again!)

(Brijesh: Bahir, is that you?)

Crane: What's going on here?

Brijesh: Bahir's locked himself in the room. We could hear him screaming.

Chris: He may have turned.

Brijesh: You hear that?!

Chris: I can't get this lock.

Chris: You want to try it?

Crane: Bahir? You in here?

Bahir: Help me!

Crane: Tell me what's wrong.

Bahir: I can't move... My chest feels like it's going to explode!

Crane: Are you turning?

Bahir: (No!) No! I took Antizin and then the pain started. The vial is on the floor.

Crane: What you took is junk.

Bahir: What?!

Crane: It's fake. Where did you get this from, Bahir?

Bahir: Please, I need a doctor.

Crane: First tell me who sold you that.

Bahir: I can't. I promised. This guy is very useful... he brings me things from the outside.

Crane: (Yeah.) Like phony Antizin.

Crane: People could be giving it to their kids. You want them to go through this?

Bahir: No. God no.

Crane: Then tell me who sold it to you.

Bahir: Yusuf. He's one of the scouts. He lives on the roof.

Crane: (Okay.) I'll get Doctor Lena.

(Bahir: Ugh! Please hurry!)

Chris: What happened?

Chris: Did you kill him?

Crane: What!? No! Look, he's not turning, but he needs a doctor.

Crane: You'd better have a look at this.

Lena: The lot number's wrong. Is this a fake?

Crane: Someone on 21 took it, and now he can't even get off the floor.

Lena: Aman, get down to 21, now!

Lena: Where'd he get it from?

Crane: Yusuf. He's one of the scouts.

Lena: Well, he can't be producing it here. Someone's supplying him.

Crane: I'll have a talk with Yusuf.

Lena: The sooner, the better.

Lena: Don't hurt him. Just talk to him.

Crane: Yusuf?

Yusuf: Welcome to Yusuf's Emporium! If it's hard to find, you need to find Yusuf! Whatever your needs, Yusuf has it all!

Crane: (Yeah.) I'm looking for Antizin.

Yusuf: Well, of course you are.

Yusuf: My friend, this is your most lucky day.

Crane: No, Yusuf, it's your lucky day, because I'm going to give you a chance to come clean and tell me where you got that counterfeit junk you sold to Bahir.

Yusuf: Bahir? Bahir, you say? Do I know this... Bahir?

Crane: He nearly died from that phoney Antizin you sold him.

Yusuf: Phoney?! Are you sure?! You're saying it's no good? I just bought ten vials from those guys. I paid good money!

Crane: Which guys?

Yusuf: Well, that's kind of a sensitive issue.

Crane: Which guys, Yusuf? I'm running out of patience.

Yusuf: There's a building next to the drug store. A couple of survivors live there. I don't know how many. I've never been inside.

Yusuf: They have medicines-some of them are real-I guess from the drug store. But they also cook their own stuff. The guy I deal with is named Bento.

Crane: You're going to burn the rest of those vials.

Yusuf: But they cost me a lot of money!

Crane: It'll cost you a lot more if I find you peddling that junk anymore.

====Outside the Tower====
Lena: Crane? It's Lena.

Crane: Go ahead.

Lena: We've found two more vials of that fake Antizin. Brecken is boiling mad.

Crane: (Yeah.) I'll bet. How's Bahir?

Lena: He's stable, but if we'd gotten to him ten minutes later he wouldn't be.

Lena: This stuff is lethal, Crane. Putting them out of business is your number one priority.

Crane: (Alright.) Understood.

Bento: What can I do for you, my friend?

Crane: I hear you're selling Antizin.

Bento: Who told you that? A little bird?

Crane: The same person who told me you've been cooking up garbage and putting it in fake vials.

Bento: Garbage?! My formula is fifty times better than that crap they drop in boxes.

Bento: Not only does it keep you healthy, it gives you super strength! Incredible speed! And laser eyes! I could burn you with one look, if I wanted to!

Crane: I'm shutting you down, Bento.

Bento: Yeah. Yusuf said you'd try to make trouble.

Crane: Yeah, well... Yusuf was right!

Bento: And you're f*ck*ng dead!

Crane: Lena? It's Crane.

Lena: Yes?

Crane: You can tell Brecken that counterfeit lab is out of business.

Lena: Good work, Crane. That's a big relief. Are you alright?

Crane: I'm fine, but Yusuf tipped them off that I was coming.

Lena: I was afraid of that. Brecken was going to lock him up, but he'd already slipped out.

Crane: If he comes back, I'm going to have a word with him.

Lena: Not if Bahir gets to him first.

Lena: Good work taking out that Antizin Lab. You've saved a lot of lives.

Crane: It's only a matter of time before someone starts another one.

Lena: The danger is all those empty Antizin bottles out there. People throw them away, and then anyone can refill them with whatever they like.

Crane: You'd better start destroying them.

Lena: We've collected all the bottles in the tower, plus Brecken is offering a $10 bounty for every bottle you runners find out there.

===Gunslinger===
Mesut: Dawud must still have a lot of things in that pawnshop of his.

Mesut: Probably a bit of everything, really. Sure could use some of that stuff now.

Dawud: Look, I've got to get out of here. I need to get my wife and kid somewhere safe.

Crane: Seems to me this is about the only safe place there is.

Dawud: Safest place in the slums maybe, but the slums aren't safe. It's no place for my family.

Dawud: And I've found a way out.

Crane: You mean out of the slums?

Dawud: I can't tell you the details, but I need to get across town, and I can't do it without a gun.

Dawud: If you'll get me one, I'll tell you about a place that hasn't been looted yet. I promise you won't regret it.

Crane: (Well.) How do you know this place hasn't been looted?

Dawud: Because there's only one person that has access to this place, and you're looking at him.

Dawud: Bring me a gun and the key is yours, as well as everything you find there.

====After finding a gun====
Dawud: You got it? Great... ! Here's the key I promised you.

Dawud: It's to my old pawnshop, you know? Used to be the best in town.

Dawud: Hey, speaking of the pawnshop, would you do me another favor?

Dawud: I need you to bring me something from the shop. You're going there anyway, right?

Crane: What is it?

Dawud: It's a... don't laugh, OK? It's a Ray McCall action figure. I know it sounds silly, but... it means a lot to my son.

====Going back to the Tower====
Brecken: Attention everyone. This is Brecken. If anyone sees Dawud, get him back to the Tower ASAP!

Brecken: He's got a gun, I repeat: he's got a GUN. He winged a guard on his way out.

Crane: Oh, no.

Survivor: What the hell happened? I heard the shots!

Lee: I knew he was going to snap. How'd he get a gun?

Survivor: Just glad he didn't kill anyone.

Crane: What happened? Where's Dawud?

Salma: He... He's gone! And he's taken my boy!

Crane: Can you tell me what happened?

Salma: He's wanted to leave for weeks, but I thought it was too dangerous. We've been fighting about it.

Salma: Then he got a gun and took all of our money and kidnapped Sammy! HE TOOK MY SON!

Crane: Do you know where he's going?

Salma: He said he found a way out, but I don't know what it means. He wouldn't tell me.

Salma: (La la la.) How could he do this?

Salma: How did he get a gun?

Crane: I'm sorry, Salma. I got it for him. He said he would use it to get both of you out.

Salma: (La la la.) Dawud doesn't want me. He hasn't wanted me for a long time. Now he has what he wants.

Crane: I'll get your son back, Salma. I don't know how, but I will.

Crane: Dawud! Answer me. Answer me, you son of a b*tch!

Dawud: No need to shout, Crane. No need to follow me, either. It's pointless.

Dawud: Please, tell Salma I'm sorry. I had no choice. Sammy's gonna be safe, I swear.

Crane: Wait, don't... Dawud? Dawud! Where are you?! ... Sh*t.

===Hardware===
Fatin: This is Fatin. Stop eating termites off that stick, and get here immediately.

Fatin: Was that simple enough?

Tolga: Yes, but you're holding down the talk button-and who told you, you could use my radio?

Fatin: The same person who told you, you could eat my sandwich.

====Fishermen's Village====
Fatin: Good to see you again, Mister...

Fatin: ... what his name?

Tolga: Crane - like the mindless machine that lifts heavy things.

Crane: Tell me what you need, and I'll be on my way.

Tolga: Duct tape...

Fatin: Cables...

Tolga: We need 10 rolls of duct tape.

Fatin: No! We need ten power cables.

Tolga: Duct tape!

Fatin: Cables!

Tolga: Duct tapes!

Fatin: Cables!

Tolga: Duct tape!

Crane: (Look.) I get it. You need both.

Tolga: Precisely.

Fatin: Precisely.

Tolga: And that concludes talking to you. Get going.

(Fatin: Shoo! Shoo! Move along!)

(Tolga: Is that moss growing on you? Start moving!)

(Fatin: Time passes but he does not move...)

(Tolga: Entropy compels change and yet you somehow remain here... unchanged.)

====After getting the materials====
Crane: Ten rolls of duct tape, ten cables.

Tolga: You've done well, simian.

Fatin: You are performing far beyond your capabilities.

Tolga: Of course, they say to improve your game, you should play with someone better than yourself.

Fatin: Clearly, contact with Tolga and I has significantly increased your intelligence.

Tolga: So, you are welcome.

Fatin: One more task and we will be done.

Crane: What do you need?

Tolga: There is a military base on the other side of the collapsed bridge. You will zip line across to it.

Tolga: Using the borrowed intelligence we have imbued you with, you will find a military-grade mobile sonar unit. Bring it to us.

Fatin: Bring it to us.

Tolga: Mr. Dal will want to see you as well, so please use some deodorant, and try not to drool on yourself so much.

Tolga: Alright, get going. Watching you is painful.

Tolga: Is that moss growing on you again? Start moving.

Fatin: Maybe he'll move if we look away.

Tolga: General relativity states that all things are in motion - but somehow you are not.

Crane: Tolga, it's Crane. I have your sonar unit.

Tolga: Sonar? (Oh!) We don't need that now.

Fatin: Who told you we needed it now? Where did you get this idea?

Tolga: Get off my radio, Fatin!

Crane: Just let me know when you need it. Crane out.

===Hunting Goon===
Crane: What the... What's wrong with me?

Crane: Maybe a stronger elixir would have fewer side effects.

Dahlia: So, you are ready to try a more powerful elixir? It will make you more useful to me. But it will require agents of greater potency.

Crane: Just tell me what you need, Dahlia.

Dahlia: Bring me the liver of a powerful immortui. It must be a giant of great physical strength.

Crane: Return when you have what I need.

====Returning to Dahlia====
Dahlia: Yes! That's it! Let me see it!

Dahlia: What terrible strength this creature wields. Perfect!

Dahlia: Consuming this elixir may have consequences. Then again, it may not .

Dahlia: If you think your system can endure more powerful agents, I can produce elixirs of still greater potency. I will summon you again when the time comes.

===Incense Herbs===
Toygar: Lavender! (Oh!) I can smell it already. This is really going to raise our quality of life.

Toygar: Not as much as killing all the zombies would, but it's a start.

===Kidney Punch===
Crane: Wwwhhhhhhaaaaaatttt ... tttthhhhhheeeee ... ... ... fffffffffffffff******ckkkkk.

Crane: Well, that almost worked. Maybe I should let Dahlia try again.

Dahlia: I call and you come, and so quickly now. You are developing very nicely for me.

Dahlia: You are ready to endure more powerful elixirs?

Crane: I'll take all the edge I can get. Now, tell me what you need.

Dahlia: My elixirs effect the mind of the immortui - and what is in the mind, is first in the blood... so I must have what is in their blood.

Dahlia: Bring me the kidney from the erupting one that sacrifices its body in attack.

====Returning to Dahlia====
Dahlia: Once more you have done my bidding! Give it to me!

Dahlia: There, it is ready. Take it!

Dahlia: My power grows as you become useful.

Dahlia: But I can create mixtures of even greater potency. When you are ready, I will create them for you.

===Lighter Gas===
Toygar: Afra has gas on the brain, but I guess you need it for his line of work. Takes all kinds to make a world.

Toygar: Even his kind, which is one of the worst kinds, if you ask me. He said I should give you this.

===Midnight Bride===
Gursel: (So.) It's you again? Tell Rais that he can bite... Hey, what's that? Have you brought the herbs?

Gursel: (Oh!) That's what I'm talking about! No more food scavenging from now on!

Gursel: Well, I still can't figure you out... But here's your prize. I think you deserved it.

===Mother's Day===
Lena: Look, there's something else we need to discuss. Brecken was hurt pretty badly out there. Worse than he wants people to know.

Lena: He took a blow to the head. Now he's starting to have seizures, and I don't have any Loratrax.

Crane: I doubt anyone does. Anti-seizure drugs were being passed out like candy when the infection first started. The stores ran out weeks ago.

Lena: Yes, that's right. How'd you know that?

Crane: What do you need me to do, Lena?

Lena: There's a man in town named Gazi. He's not all together there, if you know what I mean.

Lena: His mother had epilepsy, so he used to pick up medicine for her each month.

Lena: She died two years ago, but Gazi kept going to the store to pick up her prescription.

Lena: He likes his routine, and Gazi can be very... Insistent. So they kept giving it to him.

Crane: You think he's been stockpiling it all this time?

Lena: If he hasn't I don't know where else we're going to get it from.

Lena: Gazi lives under the overpass.

Lena: And don't mention his mother's death. He won't understand.

====Gazi====
Crane: Gazi? Is anybody in here?

Crane: Gazi? Are you there?

Gazi: If Mama ain't happy, nobody happy! So you'd better make Mama happy!

Crane: Gazi?

Gazi: Me too. We have the same name. Are you from the video store?

Crane: No, my name's Crane.

Gazi: Crane? Crane rhymes with train, and brain, and sane, and grain, and rain, and plain, and the other kind of plane, and-

Crane: (Look.) Can I come in?

Gazi: No! It's impossible! Impossible! This is my special day with Mom.

Gazi: It's Mother's Day, and it's the most important day in the whole world. Are you from the video store?

Crane: Why do you keep asking me that?

Gazi: Because you're supposed to bring my movie about me. It's called "Charly", and it's all about me, and how smart I am.

Crane: Look, Gazi, if I bring you your movie, will you let me come in?

Gazi: Sure. You could watch with us. It's Mother's Day, and if Mama ain't happy, nobody happy.

Gazi: Oh! And she also wants chocolate! Mama wants chocolate!

Crane: (No, no, no.) Wait a minute. That's too much.

Gazi: Don't argue with Gazi. It doesn't work. That's what the drug store people say.

Crane: Sonofab*tch, not now!

Crane: Charly, Charly... C for Charly...

Crane: Gotcha.

Gazi: Yes?

Crane: Here's your movie and your chocolates.

Gazi: Wait 'till mom see this! Gazi wins again! Hurray for Gazi!

Crane: Right.

Crane: Okay then, I'll just let myself in through the roof.

Crane: Hello, Gazi.

Gazi: Shhh! The movie is on. Mama's watching.

Crane: Is mama happy?

Gazi: Mama's real happy. Gazi got her chocolates and a movie.

Crane: Then I'm going to take some medicine to help my friend.

Gazi: Well... okay. Mama stopped getting seizures when her head turned into a pumpkin. They're on the table.

Crane: Thanks, Gazi.

Gazi: Gazi makes everybody happy.

====The Tower====
Crane: (Alright.) I've got your anti-seizure medicine.

Lena: Thanks. How'd things go with Gazi?

Crane: He may be challenged, but he's very good at getting what he wants.

Lena: Did you meet his Mom?

Crane: Yeah, she seemed happy.

Lena: If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

Lena: Speaking of which, Brecken asked me to pass this on to you, with his thanks.

===O Brother Where Art Thou?===
Derek: Rais's people are everywhere. I just saw some of them in the tunnel near the lake.

Derek: I couldn't tell exactly what they were doing, but they looked pretty busy.

(Osman: Nazim! Nazim, can you hear me? Nazim, come in! Nazim... Nazim, are you there? Come in, Nazim!)

Crane: What is it?

Osman: So you remember me? I know I remember you. You were at Rais' camp when I lost my hand. You're one of Brecken's guys. If you were anyone else, I'd kill you.

Crane: Lucky me.

Osman: That's right. As for Rais, I'll settle with that psycho in my own time. But first I need your help to find my brother, Nazim. He's the one who helped me escape.

Osman: He went for food at the supermarket, but he hasn't been back since. I'll pay you to find him.

Crane: What do you intend to pay me with?

Osman: (Hah!) Are you kidding? My brother and me worked for Rais. You know what that means? Collecting stuff. That's all we ever did.

Osman: We look for stuff, we find stuff, we take stuff. Well, we wound up with a lot of stuff.

Osman: Some of it we'd turn over to Rais. Some of it we kept ourselves - you know, in case things got too crazy.

Osman: Not like stealing, but protecting for the future. That's just smart, right?

Crane: Until you got caught.

Osman: We've still got plenty left. Weapons, medicine, money. We've got stashes all over the city.

Osman: But now Rais's men are looking for us, so I have to be careful going out... So we've got a deal?

Crane: I'll think about it.

Osman: It will be worth your while... I promise!

====Supermarket====
Nazim: Aaaah! Aaaargh!

Bandit: Is this how you want it to be Nazim? We used to be friends.

Nazim: You b*st*rds! I'm not telling you anything!

Bandit: No problem, Nazim. We've got time. And you still have seven fingers left. Oh wait... six.

Nazim: Aaaaaaah!!

Bandit: We know you've hidden supplies around town. Rais wants them back. There's no sense lying to us.

Nazim: Alright, maybe we did take a few things-and hid them up your stinking... AAAAAHHHHHHH!

Bandit: Come on! He'll attract all of the Infected if he keeps screaming like that!

Bandit: Then put a gag on him, because he's going to be screaming a whole lot more.

Crane: Oh sh*t...

Nazim: Who the hell are you?!

Crane: Your brother is paying me to find you.

Nazim: (Oh.) Well, you've definitely earned your money. But Osman is in danger. Rais's men know where he is now.

Nazim: It's a lot to ask, but could you take him a message?

Nazim: Tell Osman that he's got to get out of there, and that he should meet me at the Red Wall stash. He'll know what that means.

Crane: Alright, I'll tell him Now, we'd both better get out of here.

====Osman's hideout====
Osman: Another minute and I'd be a dead man. I thought maybe you sold me out.

Crane: Rais's men got your brother. He talked before I could get to him.

Osman: So Nazim is dead?

Crane: No, no. He's all right, though you're both short a few fingers now. Anyway, he says he wants you to meet him at the Red Wall stash. He said you'd know what that means.

Osman: It means you didn't double-cross me. You're a straight shooter, Brecken's guy. You want to join me and my brother?

Crane: Yeah... No. I'll just take my pay.

Osman: Fair enough. I promised you good, this is good. These keys will open three stashes in different parts of the Slums. If you can get to them, they're all yours.

Osman: Good luck, Brecken's guy.

===On The Hooks===
Crane: What's on your mind?

Messenger: Mr. Crane, are your familiar with a man named Volkan Yasif Dal?

Crane: Volkan Dal? Of course. He's owns Volkan Petrol Engineering. He's the richest man in Harran.

Messenger: That's exactly right... And Mr. Dal has need of your service.

Crane: I didn't know he was still in the city.

Messenger: Most of his employees were evacuated, but his two chief engineers are still here in the slums. They're brothers - twins, in fact. Tolga and Fatin.

Messenger: They've been working on a special project. It's highly confidential, and I'm afraid I can't discuss it, but I can assure you, it's importance is nearly beyond measure.

Crane: Then I won't bother trying to measure it.

Messenger: The brothers are brilliant engineers, but they're also somewhat... idiosyncratic.

Messenger: This, and the problems of operating in the current environment, have put them behind schedule.

Messenger: Mr. Dal would like you to assist them to get the project back on track. You will be well compensated, as you can imagine.

Crane: Doing what?

Messenger: Simply do as they ask. You will only be needed from time to time, and the tasks will be of short duration. Removing obstacles, you might say.

Messenger: They'll contact you when your assistance is required.

Crane: I'll think about it.

====Fatin and Tolga====
Tolga: Is this Crane? Can you hear me on this thing?

Crane: (Yeah.) Who is this?

Tolga: This is Tolga.

Fatin: And Fatin!

Tolga: We work for Mr. Dal, and we are ready to put you to task. Get here on the double! Make it quick!

Fatin: That's rude, Tolga! Don't talk to him like that!

Tolga: Shut up, Fatin! Get off the radio!

Fatin: You're going to make him mad, you idiot!

Tolga: Stop talking or I'll punch you!

Fatin: Punch me?! I'll kill you!

Crane: Idiosyncratic. Great.

Tolga: We are waiting for you.

Fatin: Yes. Hurry up! You're putting us behind schedule!

Crane: Are you Tolga and Fatin?

Fatin: Yes, how did you surmise that?

Tolga: Who cares how his ape brain processes information. We have a job for him.

Fatin: Quite right, Tolga.

Fatin: Remember, simple words only. Don't confuse him.

Tolga: We need to move some equipment across town. It's very heavy.

Crane: How heavy?

Fatin: Too heavy for you, simian beast. Instead we will propel it across the sky using heavy gauge zip lines. A brilliant idea, don't you think?

Tolga: That was my idea!

Fatin: No it wasn't!

Crane: Just tell me what you need.

Tolga: Well... hooks, obviously.

Fatin: How else can we hang the equipment off the lines?

Fatin: You'll find them at the train yard warehouses.

Fatin: Does he know what a warehouse is?

Tolga: Probably not.

Fatin: Look it up, but be quick about it. This project is far more important than anything your proto-human cranial cogitator is capable of understanding.

Tolga: And don't try to figure it out what it is.

Fatin: (Oh!) Heavens, no! You'd give yourself an aneurysm.

====After getting the hooks====
Crane: I have your hooks.

Tolga: (Hah!) Incredible. We have underestimated him.

Fatin: Well, we can hardly be blamed for that. Look at him.

Crane: Are we done?

Tolga: You're done. We have work to do.

Fatin: When we're finished, we'll leave some zip lines up for you.

Tolga: Yes, we know how you primates like to swing from the vines.

===Poisonous Herbs===
Musa: You have my Wolf's Bane. Good. I'm sure it was not an easy task.

Musa: Wait, I've got something for you. You've earned it.

===Searchlights===
Alfie: Come and see me when you get back. I've got something for you.

Alfie: Crane, the man who got the power back on. Take this. Sorry if I'm not sounding too grateful, but I'm having a piece of sh*te day, you know?

Crane: Anything I can help with?

Alfie: Yes, but Brecken won't authorize it. Too risky, he says.

Crane: Is it something we need?

Alfie: Okay. Brecken says we need better security at night. Too many nocturnals on our doorstep. Right?

Alfie: So, I put together a new light rig, using these big 10 kilowatt UV lamps. It's massive. Turn it on, it'll torch a volatile at 200 feet.

Alfie: It would be f*ck*ng nuclear, but the UV bulbs to run it are stuck in the towers of the Infamy Bridge.

Crane: The bridge? (Woah, woah.) Wait a minute, are you talking about the Infamy firewall?

Alfie: Sure. Biggest UV lamps in the hemisphere.

Crane: Alfie, that system didn't work. It was (a) disaster. (I mean.) When it failed, they had to destroy the bridge.

Alfie: Well, it wouldn't have failed if they hadn't lost power. And when you restarted those substations, the system came back on line. You can see it at night now.

Crane: So, you need someone to get the bulbs.

Alfie: Sure-sure. But here's the thing. Some of the bulbs have burned out. Right? They're no good.

Alfie: So, the only way to tell which ones still work is to collect them when the system is powered on.

Crane: Another night run.

Alfie: Getting in wouldn't be too hard.

Crane: (Yeah.) But once you remove the working bulbs...

Alfie: ... you'll be in a pitch-black bridge, with a whole bunch of problems.

Alfie: Yeah. You know what? Maybe Brecken's right about this one. Forget I mentioned it. But it's a d*mn shame.

====The Tower====
Alfie: You need something? Get in line. We're already swamped.

Crane: I've brought you something to brighten your mood.

Alfie: My lights! YOU GOT THE BRIDGE LIGHTS? How?! No. Never mind how. None of my business.

Crane: And none of Brecken's either. You just tell him you found them in a shoebox.

Alfie: You're my ace new partner, Crane. I'm going to take care of you.

Alfie: Tomorrow night we're going to be a lot more secure.

===Spare Glasses===
Crane: Hey - I saw your notice on the bulletin board.

Khaliq: You're a runner? Excellent. That idiot Dawud sat on my glasses in the canteen, and I'm blind as a bat. How can I help Alfie if I can't see anything?

Khaliq: I've got a backup pair at my place - it's not far away, it's just, y'know... I can't get there myself...

Crane: Need anything else while I'm there?

Khaliq: Oh my God, you'll do this for me? Thank you! Oh, and one more thing...

Khaliq: See, we're going to start a vegetable garden on the roof - y'know, so we can maybe not starve to death - but nobody here really knows how to do it.

Khaliq: On my birthday I got a book on gardening. I never read it. It's "Growing vegetables for Dum-Dums" or something like that.

Khaliq: It should be on a bookcase, but, y'know... you might have to look around for it.

====At Khaliq's house====
Crane: 1001 Banana Recipes...

Crane: On a bookcase, he said... (Okay.)

Crane: How To Look Good Over 40?

Crane: DVD player user manual...

Crane: Simple Tricks To Get The Chicks...

Crane: Big Book of Death Metal...

Crane: Do It Yourself - A Horse Head Mask... very 2013...

Crane: Big Butt Bonanza... nice...

Crane: The Falafel Diet...

Crane: Wet Dream - the first romance novel for plumbers... good God...

Crane: Seed to Feed, A Couch Potato's Guild to Vegetable Gardening. That's the one.

====The Tower====
Khaliq: You've got my glasses AND the book?! That's great!

Khaliq: Good Lord - my glasses are filthy! What have you been doing with them?

Khaliq: (No.) No never mind. It doesn't matter. Her, let me give you something for your trouble.

===Steal from a Thief===
Crane: What's up?

Deniz: You know Jaffar, right? The one from the garage. He's looking for a good runner.

Crane: For what?

Deniz: He wouldn't talk about it on the radio. I think it's something important.

Crane: Hmm... okay.

Crane: Hey, you've been looking for a runner.

Kurt: (Well.) We're looking for one who'll say yes, instead of no. Jaffar can fill you in.

Jaffar: Sh*t... it's you again? I mean... what are you doing here?

Crane: Relax... Relax... I don't work for Rais. That was a one-time job, and it was all about protecting the Tower. Look, I'm sorry... I mean it.

Jaffar: Is that right?

Crane: Look, everything I was doing... I was doing for Brecken. You can ask anyone in the Tower, if you don't believe me... So, what do you got, Jaffar?

Jaffar: We've been picking up some of Rais' transmissions. One of his crews found something at the construction site, and they got very excited.

Jaffar: They didn't say what it was, but they referred to "bringing down the entire Tower in one shot".

Jaffar: Someone's got to find out what it is, and either confiscate it or destroy it.

Crane: Well, I'm someone.

Jaffar: Congratulations, the job is yours.

Jaffar: We'll be in touch!

====After collecting the dynamite====
Crane: Jaffar? Rais's men really found something.

Jaffar: Something valuable?

Crane: Yeah, is dynamite worth a lot?

Jaffar: Dynamite is gold! We could cook you up something special with that. Kurt's a natural when it comes to this stuff.

Crane: Alright... One pack for you, the rest for me.

Jaffar: Kurt will figure out how to give it some oomph...

Jaffar: We'll be in touch!

===The Big Bang Thesis===
Jaffar: Crane? Jaffar here. About the dynamite you brought... we've got an idea how to improve it. Drop by as soon as you can.

Crane: Okay.

Kurt: (Hey.) Crane, we've got a job for you!

Kurt: Crane! That dynamite of yours, I'm making it into an anti-personnel bomb. It'll mow down the Infected like a harvester.

Kurt: I'm going to combine it with firecrackers and a load of shrapnel but I'm missing a few things, starting with a suitable casing.

Kurt: A battery from a truck would be perfect. There's this big truck on the overpass... Well, it's hanging over the edge of the overpass... but...

Kurt: You're an athletic type. You'll be fine.

Crane: I've got your battery, Kurt.

Kurt: (Okay.) So we've got a casing. Next, I'll need some metal scrap from the junkyard to use for shrapnel.

Kurt: After that, I need sugar and some cables. Try the shops or warehouses...

Kurt: Bring 'em back, and you'll get a bomb that'll blast around a hundred Infected at once.

Crane: Sold.

====Turned in Metal Parts====
Crane: This should take care of the shrapnel.

Kurt: Good job, Crane.

====Turned in Power Cables====
Crane: Are these cables alright?

Kurt: They'll do.

====Turned in Household Supplies====
Crane: Sugar. Not the cleanest.

Kurt: Doesn't matter. We're making a bomb, not a cup of tea.

Kurt: Alright, we've got everything. Give me some time. I'll let you know when I'm done.

Kurt: Crane? Kurt here. The bomb's ready, c'mon.

Crane: Okay, I'll see you there.

Crane: You've got a bomb for me?

Kurt: I've got a prototype. It's on the table, ready to be tested.

Kurt: There's a barricaded tunnel nearby. It's chock-full of volatiles during the day, but at night it should be pretty clear.

Kurt: You won't find a better place to test this bomb.

Crane: Okay, I'll try the tunnel and let you know how it went.

Kurt: One more thing... Remember about the firecrackers. The bomb will go off as soon as they're done popping.

Kurt: That's how much time you have to get the hell away. Good luck.

Crane: (Hey.) Kurt!

Kurt: I'm here, Crane

Crane: No good. It's not working.

Kurt: Not working? Huh. That's unexpected Alright, a little on the fly surgery should do the trick.

Kurt: First, open the casing by making an incision just below the negative terminal post.

Kurt: Peel back the casing along the incision line, to reveal the trigger wiring harness.

Kurt: Now, check the solder on two green wires, and the three red ones.

Kurt: I'm betting it's the green wire... I was drinking when I did them, which I now realize was perhaps irresponsible of me.

Crane: (Woah!) That did it.

Crane: It blew up the nest AND the barricade. The tunnel is now passable.

Kurt: (Hey.) I told you, my friend. If I build it, it's going to explode.

Kurt: Come see me, and I'll give you the blueprint.

Kurt: This is for you. I've also modified the case a bit. Cans instead of batteries.

Kurt: Smaller bang, but cans are easier to find. And to carry.

Crane: (Alright.) Thanks, Kurt.

===The Prodigal Son===
Alexei: Hey you! Come over here! I'm on the antenna, do you see me?

Alexei: I'm up here, I need your help!

Alexei: I need your help finding my son, Kristov.

Crane: You work for Rais, don't you?

Alexei: Sure, for protection. But I can't go to him for a thing like this.

Alexei: My son is... He's young. He thinks with his mouth instead of his head. He doesn't understand that sometimes you've got to go along with people who aren't so good.

Alexei: Now he's run off to join Brecken's bunch at the Tower. He thinks he's going to be a runner.

Crane: It's not the safest line of work.

Alexei: He's going to get himself killed. He's not ready. He's too young to be out there.

Crane: Shouldn't you be looking for him yourself?

Alexei: You don't understand. I make weapons for Rais. If the new ones aren't ready when his people come, me and Kristov are both dead.

Alexei: Please! Do this for me, I'll give you something good. Something special. Okay?

Crane: Maybe I'll ask around at  the Tower. If I find something, I'll let you know.

Crane: But if you ask me, your "protection" seems to have you pretty scared. You should really think about it.

====The Tower====
Crane: You wouldn't happen to know where Kristov is, would you?

Deniz: Kristov? You mean the new scout?

Deniz: Ayo's supervising all the scouts. Why don't you ask him? He's on the 19th floor.

Ayo: Copy. Alright, that's it, there's nothing more you can do.

Ayo: Yeah, well, Rais can throw a lot more bodies at them than we can.

Ayo: No, negative. Cut your losses and get out of there.

Ayo: Copy. Out.

Ayo: Hey, Crane. Back from the field.

Crane: No, not for long - Do you know about a scout named Kristov?

Ayo: (Ugh...) The new kid. Yeah. He went on a recon mission, but I haven't heard from him in a while.

Ayo: Rahim checked him out and said he was solid, but I'm not so sure.

Crane: One reckless kid certifying another.

Ayo: That's what Brecken said. Of course, it could just be his radio. Some of the batteries are running down, so we're not getting much range out of them.

Crane: Where was he headed?

Ayo: Out towards that newly constructed skyscraper. Crane: I'd better go have a look.

Ayo: (Hmm.) Watch yourself out there, alright?

====Finding Kristov====
Kristov: Can anyone read me? This is Kristov. I need help!

Crane: I read you, Kristov. This is Crane. Where are you?

Kristov: I found some survivors. They're in pretty bad shape. We're just outside the Hostel.

Crane: Hold tight, Kristov. I'm on my way.

Kristov: Can you see us?! We're holed up in a bus, and we're completely surrounded by Infected!

Crane: Okay, Kristov. I can see you. I'm going to get you out of there, but the first thing I need you to do is stop cranking that engine. You're just drawing them in.

Kristov: Right. Yes. I wasn't thinking.

Crane: Now stay put and sit tight. I'm going to secure the area.

Kristov: Do you need help?

Crane: Negative, Kristov! Stay with the wounded. That's an order.

Crane: Alright, I've secured a safe zone.

Kristov: Whew! Never been so scared in my life. Is it always like that?

Crane: Pretty much. But you kept your head on, and you saved those people's lives. That's not bad for your first time out.

Kristov: Thanks, Crane. But if you hadn't shown up we'd all be dead.

Crane: How do you think your dad would feel about that?

Kristov: My dad? Oh no! Did he send you?!

Kristov: Look, I'm not going to go back. I can't. I'm not working for Rais and his butcher squad.

Crane: Look, I'm not asking you to go back.

Kristov: Well, that's what my dad wants, isn't it?

Crane: He wants you to be safe.

Kristov: Yeah. Working for Rais. How safe is that?

Crane: It isn't. Sooner or later they're going to kill him. But if I can get your dad to stop working for Rais, will you hang up your running shoes?

Kristov: You're asking a lot.

Crane: You could make weapons for Brecken - God knows they need them. And you'd be saving your dad's life.

Kristov: Okay. Get him to join me here, and I'll quit being a runner.

====Back to Alexei====
Alexei: Did you find him?

Crane: Yes, I did. Your son is in one of our secured zones.

Alexei: But... I thought you were going to bring him back.

Crane: He's not coming back, Alexei. He's a scout, working for Brecken. And unless he gets a lot better at it in a hurry, he's not going to last too long.

Alexei: But... couldn't you talk some sense into him?

Crane: No, so I'm going to have to talk some sense into you. You want to save your son?

Crane: Stop making weapons for Rais, and go to the Tower. Your son said he'll give up being a runner if you'll join him.

Alexei: No! No! Sooner or later Rais is going to tear that place down! It's not safe there!

Crane: It's not safe anywhere, Alexei - and the question is, who's side are you on? See, right now you're on the wrong side, and your son doesn't want to have any part of it.

Alexei: You're right. He is ashamed of me. I am ashamed of me! But I'm just trying to do what's best for him.

Crane: Well then today is your lucky day Alexei, because what's best for him is also the right thing to do.

Alexei: Okay. You win.

Crane: What the...

Rais's Bandit: Sorry, Alexei. Rais is terminating your contract!

Rais's Bandit: We got all the machetes we need, so we don't need you!

Rais's Bandit: Thanks for all the great blades, Alexei. They're perfect for hacking you up!

Rais's Bandit: Where's your big mouth kid?! Rais wants us to give him an extra mouth!

Alexei: You were right. It was always just a matter of time before they would come for me.

Crane: They may come to the Tower eventually.

Alexei: They will. But it is where I should be. With my son.

Alexei: In my case, there's a weapon I designed. Something special. I never crafted one, because I didn't want to give it to Rais. I want you to take it.

Alexei: Good luck, Crane. Perhaps I will see you again.

===Total Security===
Crane: What've you got?

Jaffar: Someone must have turned the antenna on. We're picking up signals from all over town. One of them is from Hanson's group.

Jaffar: Hanson used to run security at the Tower, but he thought the building was too vulnerable.

Jaffar: He wanted to move everyone to a new location. Of course, Brecken wouldn't have it.

Jaffar: So him and some others up and left. We never heard from them after that - until today. You can hear for yourself.

Seref's Voice: This is Seref, I'm with Hanson's group. There's been an accident, and we need help.

Seref's Voice: I'm concerned who might be listening, so I can't be specific. Please come quickly.

Jaffar: It just repeats.

Crane: Does Brecken know about this?

Jaffar: He said until we actually talk to someone, he doesn't want to risk sending a runner out there.

Crane: (Alright.) Maybe I'll go out and have a look.

Jaffar: I'd appreciate it. Hanson ran a tight ship. I can't understand how things could've gone wrong with him in charge.

====Hanson====
Crane: Jaffar, it's Crane. I'm at the building. (Listen.) The entire outer structure is electrified.

Jaffar: That's Hanson's trademark. He was the first to rig the electric traps. He's got a real knack for it.

Crane: Okay, I'm going to shut it off.

Crane: Jaffar, I think I found Hanson. Looks like he took a fall, and then the biters finished him off. He's been dead for a while.

Jaffar: What about the others?

Crane: I'll let you know when I found something.

====Atop the building====
Seref's Recording: This is Seref. It seems we've run out of options.

Seref's Recording: Two weeks ago, Hanson fell off the scaffold, right after switching on the security system.

Seref's Recording: But now the entire building is electrified, and we've been trapped up here ever since.

Seref's Recording: No one's responded to our distress calls, and we've run out of supplies.

Seref's Recording: The only thing left is some cyanide that Hanson thoughtfully brought with him.

Seref's Recording: Anyway, given the choices, we've all decided to go this way.

Seref's Recording: There was talk of trying to go cannibal, but then we'd just be smarter versions of biters. Better this way.

Seref's Recording: Besides, how smart are we for allowing Hanson to leave us stranded up here in the first place?

Seref's Recording: Thanks for finding us, whoever you are. Sorry for the mess. - Seref Hasan

Crane: Jaffar, I've found the rest of his group. They're all dead. Killed themselves.

Jaffar: Why? What the hell happened?

Crane: Looks like Hanson switched on the security grid, and then fell. The rest of his people got stranded on the roof, with no way down.

Crane: Looks like they eventually ran out of supplies, and decided to cash out.

Jaffar: They couldn't get into the building?

Crane: Seems Hanson had the only key. Guess he didn't trust anyone else.

Jaffar: No, Hanson never trusted other people.

Crane: (Yeah.) It's too bad they trusted him.

Jaffar: Thanks for going out there, Crane. Jaffar out.

===Tunnel Vision===
Blake: Hey-have you seen that house with (the) red smoke pouring out of it?

Blake: If Rais's people spot it, they're going to come knocking on his door. Someone ought to warn him.

Crane: I've got enough trouble right now, but I'll think about it.

====Ryan's Junkyard====
Ryan: Finally. I was getting worried you weren't coming.

Crane: You keep pumping red smoke in the air and you're going to have all kinds of visitors.

Ryan: Red's all I had left. Anyway, you're here, so it did the job.

Ryan: Give this envelope to Aziz at the Bazaar. Tell him it's from Ryan.

Crane: Red Phosphorus, Lye, Iodine, Muriatic Acid, Diethyl Ether, Phenyl-nitrate.

Crane: Geez, Not exactly grandma's recipe for Christmas cookies.

Crane: Lena, this is Crane. Are you there?

Aman: Crane, it's Aman. Lena's tied up. Can I help you?

Crane: Someone just gave me a grocery list with Red Phosphorus, Lye, Iodine, Muriatic Acid, Diethyl Ether, and Phenyl-nitrate.

Aman: Then someone just gave you a recipe for cooking Slam. Rais's crews have been using it to stay up for days at a time.

Aman: Volatiles are more reasonable than someone tanked up on that stuff.

Crane: Maybe I should put this guy out of business.

Aman: Actually, we're pretty desperate for Phenyl-Nitrate. It's a lab-grade disinfectant, and we're completely out of it.

Crane: You want me to pick up his shopping list?

Aman: Definitely. Then find me at the Tower. I've got an idea that should throw a monkey wrench into their operation.

====At the Bazaar====
Crane: You Aziz? Ryan sent me.

Aziz: What happened to Asam?

Crane: What do you think?

Aziz: You guys take a lot of chances out there.

Aziz: Look, I've got everything but the Phenyl-Nitrate.

Crane: Then you don't have what I need, and that's not going to cut it with Ryan.

Aziz: What can I do? The courier wrecked his car in a tunnel last night. He's with Asam now, and your Phenyl-Nitrate is stuck in the trunk of his car.

Aziz: You want it, go get it, 'cause there's no more in Harran. That's the last Phenyl-Nitrate anyone's going to be seeing.

Crane: What's his car look like?

Aziz: Hmmmm... White, I think. That's all I remember. White car.

Aziz: So, you're really going to do this?

Crane: Ryan doesn't like to be disappointed.

Aziz: You must be pretty tough. If you don't die doing this thing, I just might have an opportunity for you.

Crane: Aman, I've got your Phenyl Nitrate.

Aman: Fantastic! Bring it here.

====The Tower====
Aman: You're a life saver.

Crane: (Eh.) Ryan's not going to think so when I get done with him.

Aman: I've got a better idea. Bring him this instead. It's Dialovon, a sleeping aid.

Aman: Let him cook up a batch with that in it, and it'll send Rais's goons off to dreamland.

Crane: I don't think Rais will like that.

Aman: (Heh.) Probably not, but they could use the sleep.

Crane: And there's no more Phenyl-Nitrate, so I guess he's out of business either way. I like your thinking, Aman.

====Back to Ryan's Junkyard====
Bandit: Open the door, Ryan!

Bandit: You don't open that door, we're going to set fire to this place!

Bandit: You want to burn alive? Just give us the stuff!

Bandit: It's not worth dying for, Ryan! Hand it over!

Bandit: We're getting tired of asking nicely.

Bandit: Who's this idiot?!

Crane: Ryan, it's me! I've got your stuff! Open up!

Ryan: Thanks. They were just about to torch this place.

Crane: Who were those guys?

Ryan: Competitors. There's no more Phenyl-Nitrate left in Harran, so they were hoping I'd gotten my last order.

Ryan: Here's something a little extra for coming through for me.

Ryan: Guess this is going to be my last batch. Pleasure doing business with you.

Crane: You know, take some advice. After you finish your deal with Rais, why don't you go somewhere else. Don't stay here.

Ryan: Way ahead of you, pal.

Crane: (Yeah.) No, I don't think you are.

===Voltage===
Crane: You're Alfie?

Alfie: That's me. Electricity, building maintenance, I keep this place running somehow. Glad you're here. I was just about to call you.

Crane: What's the problem?

Alfie: Well, it's good news-bad news. The good news is that you restored the lights in the Cauldron district.

Alfie: The bad news is that it blew out the grid near the overpass. It's blacker than your pants pocket over there.

Crane: So, you need it switched back on?

Alfie: There're two sub-stations. Flick-flick, you switch 'em on, the order doesn't matter.

Alfie: Then you throw the master in the main station, and it'll light up like a Christmas tree.

Crane: I think I can do it.

Alfie: Of course, you can do it. Any runner could do it. But there's a catch.

Alfie: Shutting off the lights has created a little black patch for the volatiles. Bunches of them are gathering there after sundown. So I've rigged a trap.

Alfie: It's already in place, all set to go. Now, if you can get in there and restore the power after it's dark, we can fry a whole lot of freaks in one shot.

Crane: After dark? That's going to be a lot dicier.

Alfie: Sure. That's why no one's volunteered for this job. But I'm thinking maybe you're a bit tougher than the rest of these guys. Just an impression.

Crane: Let's just say I'm here to help.

Alfie: Really. Good intentions, huh? Hope you've got some guts, or you won't last long.

====Rebooting the substations====
Crane: I'm in the substation.

Alfie: Just find the control panel and turn the switch on. That'll reboot the system.

Crane: Done.

Alfie: Good, now you gotta do the same thing in the second substation.

Crane: All right, Alfie. Two down, one to go.

Crane: I'm at the main station, Alfie.

Alfie: You've got to find the main panel. It's in one of the buildings.

Crane: It's done! Fire it up now!

Alfie: Hang on! ... Hang on!

Alfie: EAT VOLTS, YOU FREAKS!

Alfie: That was good stuff, Crane. No bullsh*t.

Alfie: Look, I've got a field job to deal with, but when I get back I'm going to take care of you.

===Where's My Mother?===
Crane: What's the matter?

Meliha: That brute, Harun threw my sister Aida out of the village!

Sibel: She's a widow, with two children, Yasmina and Jamil. They snuck under the fence to go after their mother.

Sibel: Yasmina came back yesterday, but Aida and Jamil are still out there.

Meliha: Please, can you find my sister and nephew and bring them back?!

Crane: I'll do what I can. Where's the girl?

Meliha: In my house. She's hiding from Harun. She thinks he'll throw her out too.

Crane: Maybe I'll talk to Harun.

Crane: He's not here!

Meliha: Oh... well you'd better go find him.

Crane: I'm looking for Harun.

Fisherman: Harun? If a toothache was a man, it would be Harun. If you see him, could you push him into a hole?

Crane: Where can I find Harun?

Fisherman: (Yeah.) Most likely he is under the bridge. That is where most trolls reside. Eating fish heads, perhaps.

Crane: Harun?

Harun: Can't you see I'm busy?

Crane: Why did you force that woman to leave the village?

Harun: You mean Aida? She's infected. All infected gotta go outside.

Crane: Is that Gursel's rule?

Harun: Some people don't want to make the tough calls around here. Well, I did.

Harun: If Aida didn't want to get thrown out, she shouldn't have let herself get bit. Tough luck. Bad break.

Crane: What about her kids?

Harun: What about 'em? There's no Antizin around here.

Harun: I was doing them a favor so they wouldn't have to watch us hacking up their mom when she turns into a f*ck*ng monster.

Crane: I'm starting not to like you.

Harun: Hey, I'm not looking for trouble. You seem like a good guy. Have a nice day. Okay?

Harun: Now go f*ck yourself.

(Harun: My conscience is clean. I did the right thing.)

====Jamil and Yasmina====
Crane: Yasmina? I want to help your mom. Can you talk to me?

Crane: Your mom's in danger. I need to find her.

Yasmina: She's gone. She was bitten. Harun says you can't be here once you've been bitten.

Crane: I'm going to get her to a place that has medicine. They won't make her leave.

Crane: Now, can you tell me what happened to you and your brother?

Yasmina: Me and Jamil went under the fence to find our mom. It took a while, but we found her at the houses behind the tunnel.

Yasmina: Only there was a biter there. He bit me, and my mom hit him on the head.

Crane: You were bitten?

Yasmina: Only a little. I tried to get away.

Crane: What did your mom do?

Yasmina: She put us in a house, and then she went to look for medicine. When she came back, she told Jamil to wait there, and then she took me to the man.

Crane: Did he give you medicine?

Yasmina: Yes... He said we would both need more, but that me and my mom could stay in his basement as his puppets.

Yasmina: I don't know what he meant, but my mom got scared and hit him, and told me to run... So, I did.

Crane: It's alright, Yasmina. I'll find her. Where does the man live?

Yasmina: I'm not sure. It's a house with hammers... and axes.

Crane: And where's your brother?

Yasmina: Jamil is hiding in the house with the red flowers.

Crane: You're a brave girl, Yasmina, but I need you to stay here a little longer, ok? And keep away from Harun until I get back. Can you do that?

Yasmina: You're really going to find my brother and mom?

Crane: You bet I will.

Yasmina: Thank you, mister.

Jamil: Help! Mom! Help!

Crane: (Take it easy.) Take it easy... I won't hurt you. You're Jamil, right?

Jamil: Y-yes.

Crane: (Okay.) I'm looking for your mom. Can you tell me where she is?

Jamil: Yasmina was bitten by one of those creatures, so Mom took her to a man that found the medicine that fell from... the sky.

Jamil: She said his name was Salim.

Crane: Do you know where Salim lives?

Jamil: In the tool shop.

Crane: (Alright.) Listen to me, Jamil. I'm going to get your mom and come back for you. So you wait right here, okay?

Jamil: Okay. Just come back soon.

Crane: We will. Don't worry.

====Salim's Workshop====
Crane: Salim! Salim, we need to talk!

Salim: Go away! I'm armed, so you'd better get the hell out of here!

Crane: You have to let Aida go.

Salim: You mean that stupid woman? She's dead! She was infected, so I had to kill her.

Crane: (No.) Her daughter says you have Antizin.

Salim: I don't know anything about this! It has nothing to do with me!

Crane: Salim, I'm not leaving without her!

Salim: Oh yeah? So, you want to have a party? How about I invite some more guests!

Salim: When I'm done with you, I'll hunt down her children and feed them to the volatiles!

Crane: God... What has he done to you?

Crane: (Take it easy.) Take it easy, you're free.

Aida: Yasmina, my daughter... she went...

Crane: She's safe, she's back at the village. Your son is still hiding at the house where you left him.

Aida: What am I going to do?! We can't stay in the village! Harun will throw us out again!

Crane: You're going to take your kids and go to the Tower. I want you to find a doctor there named Lena.

Crane: Tell her that Crane says to take care of you, and that he'll make sure there's enough Antizin for you and your daughter.

Aida: You are Crane?

Crane: Yeah, I'm Crane.

Crane: Now go back to Jamil, he's waiting for you. Yasmina is with your sister.

Aida: Thank you for being kind to me. I didn't think there was any kindness left.

===Witch Queen===
Jared: Seems there're some survivors at the Bazaar. And the Witch is one of 'em

Jared: Guess if anyone's going to bullsh*t their way to safety, it's going to be Dahlia right?

Crane: Did you say she's a witch?

Jared: She says she's a witch. She claims the Infected won't even touch her, 'cause of her voodoo hocus-pocus.

Jared: They say she walked clean across the city without getting touched. At night.

Crane: Maybe she knows something we don't.

Jared: Yeah, Maybe. Or maybe she's just completely full of sh*t.

Crane: What's on your mind?

Jaul: Some advice. If you're going to be a runner, you should go talk to The Witch.

Crane: You mean the woman who claims the Infecte won't attack her?

Jaul: It was just after midnight, when this old woman walks right up to the gate at the Bazaar and asks to come in.

Crane: And there were Infected around?

Jaul: Yes, they were all over, but they didn't seem to notice her. She just walked right past them, calm as a cloud. I tell you... I couldn't believe it.

Jaul: You should talk to her. For the job you do, she could really help.

Dahlia: So... At last you are here.

Dahlia: I sent for you days ago. Are you always so slow?

Dahlia: Perhaps you are resistant to my summons. Good.

Dahlia: The strong ones are more difficult, but always so much more worthwhile.

Crane: You must be "The Witch".

Dahlia: Such prideful contempt! But of course, you do not believe in such things.

Crane: (Look.) I'm here because I've been told that you... have an ability.

Dahlia: You want to know how I walk among the immortui without drawing their attack. Is that not so?

Crane: Is it possible?

Dahlia: For you? No. You are far too crude and ignorant to obtain such deep knowledge. But there is another way. Something I could make for you.

Crane: It's fine... I'd be willing to trade.

Dahlia: You are only here because I wish it, and it is my wish that you have this ability. You will need it to be of service to me.

Dahlia: Tonight you will go to the caves, while the volatiles are out hunting. Collect as many black mushrooms as you can carry, and I will use them to prepare a tincture for you.

Dahlia: That is all I require from you... for now.

====Back to Dahlia====
Dahlia: This tincture will give you some ability to be among the immortui. It will not last long and it may disturb your senses.

Dahlia: Solutions of greater potency can be prepared, but they will require more powerful agents. And greater risk.

Dahlia: Now you are ready to serve me.

Crane: What do you want?

Dahlia: From you? Why, nothing at all. I will never ask anything of you, Runner. You may go about your business and do exactly as you think you should. A man of 'free will'.

Dahlia: But the truth is that you will always be doing my bidding. Even now, you are under my complete control.

Dahlia: I will summon you again when the time comes.

Dahlia: Go now. Enjoy your illusion of freedom.

Dahlia: You may leave, but we are not done. You will be back.

==Side Quests (Old Town)==

===Blocks for the Boy===
Crane: Hey there, bud. What's your name?

Kadim: Kadim.

Crane: Kadim, I like that name.

Kadim: I have a secret.

Crane: Really? So do I.

Kadim: What's your secret?

Crane: I'm a GRE agent. What've you got?

Kadim: Can you get my blocks for me?

Crane: (That's.) That's not really a secret.

Kadim: But some of them are downstairs... near the basement. And Mr. Rupert said we're not ever to go near the basement. Not EVER. But I went down there, just to see...

Kadim: ...and I heard a scary sound, and I kind of dropped my blocks. They're kind of... all over. Could you get them back for me?

Crane: (Huh.) That's a tall order. But I'll give it a shot.

====After getting all the blocks====
Crane: Here ya go, Kadim. All blocks accounted for.

Kadim: Thanks. Hey, are you going to tell Rupert about this?

Crane: (So.) WIll you keep my secret?

Kadim: That you work for the... Who was that again?

Crane: You're secret is safe, Kadim. But I'm going to talk to Rupert about those noises in the basement. I heard them too.

Rupert: Alya is okay. She's sleeping now. She'll need some time to fully recover. Thank you again, Mr. Crane.

Rupert: My wife Jasmine should be back any time now, and since I know how tiring these kids can be, I'm sure you'll be wanting to move on.

Crane: Not just yet.

Rupert: But... Well, our supplies are very limited.

Crane: This is too much responsibility for one person, Rupert. I've sent for help. They'll be here soon.

Rupert: That's not necessary. Jasmine and I can handle things just fine.

Crane: Rupert. I was downstairs.

Rupert: Oh... I see.

Crane: I'm sorry, Rupert.

Rupert: Sometimes in those noises... I think I can still hear a tiny trace of her voice.

===Chasing Past===
Zhanna: Zdrastvooyte. You look like someone who's afraid of nothing. And Zhanna knows the people like you.

Zhanna: Zhanna was like you in her youth. Zhanna was protecting people. Well... but Zhanna was doing it for money. And you're a real hero, from what Zhanna has heard. Huh?

Crane: Hmm...

Zhanna: Prasteete for my insolence, but to Zhanna you look as someone who wouldn't refuse to help a child.

Crane: What do you have in mind?

Zhanna: This boy under Tariq's care... Poor thing looks helpless. Well, they both seem helpless.

Zhanna: The boy survived something terrible, and Tariq thinks his brother is still in danger. If you could give him a helping hand...

Crane: Yeah, I get it. But I don't know if I'm right for this.

Zhanna: (Ohh...) You are. Zhanna knows, believe me.

Zhanna: Da sveedaneeya!

Crane: Where'd you find him?

Tariq: He just showed up. He barely talks and when he does, he says some strange things. A lot of it is about someone named Mike.

Tariq: The only thing he had with him was this voice recorder.

Tariq: But this fellah, Mike- it might be his brother. The kid says he left him behind. He asked me to go get him, but I don't think I can do it.

Tariq: It's too dangerous to take him with me and I don't want to leave him here alone.

Crane: Do you know where he lived?

Tariq: Dolma Street. Unit eleven- two.

Crane: Ok, maybe I'll check it out.

Tariq: Keep this recorder. Maybe it'll help you understand what happened there.

====At the apartment====
Crane: Let's see what this says.

Boy: Ekhem, ekhem, ... Detective Dooley and his assistant begin their search for: The Missing Person of Dolma Street!

Boy: Oh, Come on! You have to help me! Dad's been out all day. Come on! We're going to find him.

Boy: Ehem... The missing person of interest went out very normally to get some food, only to become missing under mysterious circumstances.

Boy: Detectives Mike and Tom Dooley are sent to look for clues in the other apartments.

Crane: Alright, boys, you were playing detective. What happened next?

Boy: Flat number three is locked. Maybe the strange man who lives here has seen something. Or maybe he saw too much!

Boy: We will interrogate him later...

Boy: Hey, where're you going?! ... Wait! Wait for me!

Boy: Detective Dooley's partner has left the area of investigation, no doubt in pursuit of some clue.

Boy: It appears that he's gone down to the basement. I'm following his lead now.

Crane: Okay, what now...

Boy: Detective Dooley reporting. I'm entering the basement to check the trace.

Boy: Mike! Are you here?

Boy: Mike? Is that you?

Crane: Oh, Jesus...

Boy: Mike!!! Miike!!!!!!!

Boy: Miiiike! Mike!!...

Boy: Aaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!

Crane: Then that was Mike...

Umar: Meat! ... Meat! ... Meat! ... Meat!

Crane: Case closed.

====Back to Tariq====
Tariq: You're back? Did you find Mike?

Crane: Mike was his dog. He's dead. So's his father. And it wasn't even the Infected. It was just some twisted creep.

Tariq: This place... It's too much for people.

Tariq: Listen, Crane... These are the keys to the museum storage. There're a lot of weapons from all different times. Maybe you'll find something useful there.

Crane: Thanks, Tariq. But there's something else I want from you.

Tariq: Sure. Anything.

Crane: You said you're not good with kids.

Tariq: No. Not really.

Crane: Well, get good.

Tariq: I will try. I give you my word.

===Do You Believe?===
Mufid: Did you hear that loud music? Someone turned it up on purpose. I wonder why?

Mufid: That guy must have a death wish.

====Ishaq's flat====
Ishaq: I know why you are here.

Ishaq: Your nemesis awaits you. He has waited a long time.

Crane: Sounds like you've met him.

Ishaq: He once sought my visions for his advantage, but I will not share my gift with such a man as him.

Ishaq: With you, I will.

Crane: How much will that cost?

Ishaq: The price will be high, but your payment will not be to me.

Ishaq: Now you will go to the river. There is a pungent nightshade that reveals itself only in the moonlight. The smolder of its embers enables the seeker to pierce the veil.

Crane: All out, are we?

Ishaq: Bring me several stalks of this plant.

Crane: Maybe I will... But in the meantime you should shut off the music. It draws attention.

Ishaq: Nothing enters that I do not wish.

Ishaq: Now I must prepare my mind.

====After collecting the night herbs====
Ishaq: You are here because you are welcome.

Crane: Your herbs.

Ishaq: Place the stalks in the brazier and we will begin.

===Dungeon===
Rupert: I was hoping it would be over by now.

Rupert: But I couldn't do it. My wife! My beautiful, beautiful Jasmine.

Crane: This has to end.

Rupert: I would let her kill me before I would lift a finger to harm her.

Crane: (Just.) Give me the basement key.

====Returning back to Rupert====
Rupert: Did you find her? Were you... able to help her?

Crane: She has peace now.

Rupert: Th-thank you. From both of us. I hope, somewhere, I may find forgiveness for what I did. For what I... couldn't do.

===Fan Zone===
Noah: If you pass the Fan Zone, please check what's happening there.

Crane: What do you mean?

Noah: You'll hear it for yourself. Someone's calling for help. There are women and children there...

Crane: Troy? There's a distress message coming from the Fan Zone.

Troy: That place should be empty.

Crane: Yeah.

Crane: Maybe I'll check it out.

====Inside the Fan Zone====
Voice: To anyone who can hear this: Your situation is dire. I've killed women and children here.

Voice: I can offer you death in exchange for your medicine, food and drinking water. Come to me...

Troy: Tell me what's happening.

Crane: I'm in the Fan Zone. This place is a trap. Keep people the hell out of here.

Troy: Understood. Now take your own advice, and get out of there.

Crane: I think I'm going to have to deal with this one, Troy. Crane out.

Voice: Ahh! So you wish to challenge me! Excellent. Take the elevator, and it will bring you straight to me.

Voice: To anyone who can hear this: Your situation is quickly deteriorating.

Voice: I've killed so many I can no longer remember them all. But they were all weak. You are weak, so you will die.

Voice: To anyone who can hear this: I'm going to cut off your head... but not right away, of course.

Voice: I used to kill people quickly, but now I take my time. I'm more... methodical. I think that's a sign of maturity, don't you?

Voice: To anyone who can hear this: I'm going to cut out your ear drums, so you won't hear anything.

Voice: You will die in total silence. Not to worry, I will hear your screams for you, so they won't go to waste.

Voice: To anyone who can hear this: I was left behind by cowards, but I've survived by awakening my natural predatory abilities.

Voice: Here I am ruler. Here I am king. Here you will die!

Voice: To anyone who can hear this: You're almost mine.

Voice: How accommodating of you to bring yourself to me. I barely have to get out of my chair to kill you.

Voice: Hurry along. One mustn't rush, but one must not dawdle either. Fate awaits.

Voice: To anyone who can hear this: You can stop fearing now. Your problems are nearly over.

Voice: I have resolved the problems of so many. Now I will solve yours.

Crane: Troy? It's Crane.

Troy: You alright?

Crane: (Yeah.) Some psycho's been luring people into the Fan Zone and hunting them. Must be 15 to 20 bodies down here.

Troy: Is he dead?

Crane: Dead as I can make him. Crane out.

===Fountain===
Mort Norris: Crane -- I'm Mort Norris. Worked in the Town Hall before the outbreak. Modernization and Maintenance of Hydraulic Infrastructure Department!

Mort Norris: One hell of a job, I'm telling you Miss it more than I miss my kids these days.

Crane: Uhh, okay. So...you wanted to ask me something?

Mort Norris: Yes! I was supposed to get water running in my neighborhood again, but I can't cause of those d*mn undead and it's KILLING me!

Mort Norris: Could I persuade you to do it? Please? It would be a great civic gesture, appreciated by tens, maybe even dozens of people!

Crane: What would I need to do?

Mort Norris: Just redirect the flow of the water! That's all! It'll be SUCH a help...and it'll even get our beautiful fountain up and running again!

Crane: ... Yeah, right. (So.) What do you want me to do, then?

Mort Norris: Great! Great! Fantastic! You just have to get to these three pumping stations and switch the valves. Here, I'll show you where they are...

====After switching all three valves====
Crane: Mort, I've switched all three valves.

Mort Norris: Brilliant! Now you just have to do the same in the main pumping station. Give me a shout once you're there.

Crane: Okay, what now...

Mort Norris: Look for the main valve.

Crane: Done. Mort? Any progress?

Mort Norris: Yes! YES! We've got water again! Not just in our building, but in my whole district, too!

Mort Norris: You did my job and you did it well! Even the fountain works again! Amazing, Crane!

Crane: (Good.) It's better to drink water than energy drinks

===Health Potion===
Crane: No insulin here.

Crane: I don't see any insulin.

Crane: Troy, can you hear me? It's Crane.

Troy: Yes, Crane? What do you need?

Crane: There's a bunch of kids in the Magic Fortress, did you know about this?

Troy: It's news to me. We thought that place was empty. Do they need assistance?

Crane: From what I've seen, yes.

Troy: It's going to take time to get anyone over there.

Crane: Understood. I'll stay until someone arrives. (Hey, look.) In the meantime, I need insulin. I'm at the drug store now, but it's been picked clean.

Troy: Maybe you could check (and see) if the computer works? There should be records of people who bought the insulin last, along with their addresses. Maybe they still have it?

Crane: Thanks Troy. Out.

====After using the computer====
Crane: Rupert, this is Crane. No luck here.

Rupert: Dammit. Alya's lying down, she doesn't look right. I think we're almost out of time.

Crane: But there is a receipt here for insulin sold to someone named Ekrem Bozkurt. Ring a bell?

Rupert: Ekrem is Alya's father. Maybe he left the insulin at their home.

Rupert: His address is on the receipt.

Crane: (Alright.) I'll head over and have a look.

====Grabbing the note on Ekrem's apartment====
Crane: Harika, I'm driving to the pharmacy to get Alya's medication, then to Farhat pizzeria, and then I'll pick up Alya from daycare.

Crane: We should be home with dinner by 6:00. We love you, my darling. Ekrem.

Crane: So he got to the pharmacy but he never picked up his daughter.

Crane: Rupert, where's Farhat Pizzeria?

Rupert: What?!

Crane: Just get me the address.

Rupert: It's near the Magic Fortress, on Mercantile Street.

====Magic Fortress====
Rupert: I can't believe you've done it!

Crane: Will she be alright?

Rupert: Yes-yes, it's exactly what she needs.

Rupert: I'll take care of Alya, but could you keep the other children busy while I'm with her?

Crane: Well, I'm really... I'm pretty busy.

Rupert: Just talk to them. That's all you need to do. I've already told them you're a great warrior. Like a knight.

Crane: You did? When's your wife coming back?

Rupert: You'll be fine. I just need a few minutes.

Rupert: Children! This heroic warrior has returned with a healing elixir for Alya!

Rupert: Now he's going to stay here and be your protector, while I administer the elixir to Alya

Crane: Well, hang on, now wait...

Rupert: I won't be long.

===Legless Spider===
Savvy: I saw a flare nearby. I'll bet someone ran into a group of bandits.

Savvy: Someone's going to be dead soon.

====Spider and David====
Spider: It's YOU! Crane! I've seen your face on the posters. You've got to help me.

Crane: What happened to you?

Spider: I took a bullet from Rais's men. I'm a runner too.

Spider: Well, almost.

Spider: Look, I'm out of commission. Can you help me out? I need you to finish this run for me.

Crane: Hey, I'll get you to a shelter or something, but I've got other things to take care of.

Spider: You don't have anything more important than this. I guarantee it.

Crane: Alright, tell me what you've got.

Spider: The source of the epidemic.

Crane: Where?

Spider: David can show you. Here's a list and a bag with the things I've already collected. The rest is on you.

Spider: When you've got it all, take it to David, and he'll tell you everything. You'll find him at the Royal Canal. Tell him Spider sent you.

Crane: What about you?

Spider: I've got a safe house nearby. I'll be fine. Just help David. That's all that matters!

(David: Leave me alone!)

(Rais's soldier: You see that? Where is it?)

(David: I don't know what you're talking about!)

(Rais' soldier: Where was it!? Where is the weapon?)

(David: I don't have it.)

(Rais' soldier: Someone's trying to help him. Kill him!)

David: Thanks. I owe you.

David: Who are you?

Crane: Crane. Spider sent me.

David: Why? What's happened to him?

Crane: He ran into Rais' people, but he'll be alright. I've brought the things he was collecting for you.

David: You're a life saver. Thanks, Crane. This is really going to make a difference.

Crane: So, tell me what this is all about.

David: Oh... I thought you knew.

Crane: I know it involves the source of the epidemic.

David: Yes. The meteorite. I know where it landed.

Crane: You think the epidemic came from space?

David: You think that's a coincidence?

Crane: You have some proof of this?

David: I did. Rais's men just took off with my last samples.

David: I was going to send Spider out for some more. Could you do it?

====Collecting meteorites====
Crane: (Alright.) I've reached the site. I don't see anything.

David: All right, listen. The meteor shards react to green light, that makes them easier to spot.

David: The hazmat guys put up some lamps and a generator. They should still be working.

Crane: Oh hell!

Crane: I should probably stop pulling this trigger.

====Back to David====
Crane: (Alright.) I've got your meteor fragments.

David: Good. I'll load the shards into the accelerator chamber, and we'll be ready to take the fight to the Reptillians.

Crane: Whoa! Wait. Who are we taking the fight to?

David: Okay, technically, they're Gadoids, from Orion, but 'Reptillians' is a recognized euphemism, even if it's a bit redneck.

Crane: Uh-huh. And these Gadoids did... what?

David: Duh... Bah... Please!

David: They came to Earth eons ago, and formed the Order of The Illuminati. Now they want to dominate us and spread around the entire Fourth Level.

David: They've been turning people into slaves, but now you're going to stop them, because you have this.

Crane: I do?

David: Remember, it's not going to cut through a fast-variable gamma shield, but short of that, it should de-atomize anything out there.

Crane: Right. Got it. Anything else?

David: I'd estimate you can count on 500 charges before you need to replace the meteor shards. So go get 'em, Soldier. Send them to hell! Envoyez-les en enfer!

Crane: (Gee.) Thanks, David. Thanks a lot.

===Lost in Space===
Dawud: Can anyone hear me? This is Dawud! I'm with a small child! We need help!

Dawud: They... they bit me... I'm turning... Please...

Dawud: We're in an apartment building opposite the abandoned construction site in the Corner district... I'm begging you... Help my son!

====After killing Dawud====
Crane: Sammy! It's Mr. Crane. Are you in here?

Sammy: Please, don't hurt me!

Sammy: Go away!

Sammy: Leave me alone!

Crane: Easy kid. (Hey.) It's all over. Are you alright?

Sammy: My dad got hurt. He said he was becoming like the other sick people, and that he couldn't protect me anymore.

Sammy: He said if I came out of the cabinet, he would hurt me, but that once he was sick I'd be safe, because he wouldn't remember I was in there.

Crane: Your dad saved your life.

Sammy: Where is he?

Crane: He's gone, Sammy. There was nothing anyone could do. Now, I have to get you back to your mom.

Sammy: I wish I could have stayed with her.

Crane: Troy, it's Crane.

Troy: Go ahead.

Crane: I've got a little boy here. He's been through a rough ride. He could use some spoiling.

Troy: I'll have someone there in five minutes.

Crane: Can we get him back to his mother at the Tower?

Troy: I'll take him there myself if I have to.

Crane: Thanks, Troy.

====Rooftop garden safe zone====
Seda: Are you the one who rescued that little boy?

Crane: How's he doing?

Seda: He's on his way back to the Tower. Brecken sent a messenger through. He had to go back anyway, so he just took Sammy with him. He'll be with his mom by tomorrow.

Crane: Thanks, that's good to know. Maybe I'll see him back at the Tower.

===Office Outpost / Radio Outpost===
'''NOTE: I have put these two side quests together as you will get the same dialogues as to which outpost you want to clear first.'''

Savvy: (Uhh.) Crane? One more thing...

Crane: Rais brought some of his Shock Squads to Old Town. They've only been here for a few weeks, but they're doing a lot of damage.

Savvy: They're launching raids, and terrorizing survivors at every opportunity. It seems Rais officially ordered them to be as brutal as possible.

Crane: (Yeah.) He likes people to know he's in town.

Savvy: They're well-fortified. In addition to their headquarters, they're using two staging grounds to gather supplies. I'm told they've amassed quite a haul.

Crane: I could use some supplies.

Savvy: (Ahh!) You'd be doing us all a very big favor.

Crane: Where're the outposts?

Savvy: One's in an office building. The other is in the radio station.

Crane: Maybe I'll pay them a visit.

====After completing the last outpost side quest====
Crane: Savvy? Crane here.

Savvy: Everything alright?

Crane: You shouldn't be seeing any more orange vests for a while.

Savvy: You did it... ?! I'll tell everybody... Thank you.

===Rupert the Gunsmith===
Fidan: Hey, one more thing?

Crane: Yeah?

Fidan: You ever use a rifle out there? If you do, you should see our gunsmith, Rupert.

Fidan: That guy can craft a Howitzer from a pop-gun.

Crane: A silencer would be more useful, but where would I find him?

Fidan: Well, that's the thing. He hasn't been in his workshop for a while. You might want to try his flat.

Crane: Maybe I'll do that.

====Magic Fortress====
Rupert: Who are you?

Crane: I'm Crane. I was looking for Rupert.

Rupert: No, you weren't. You were looking for a gunsmith, who happens to be named Rupert.

Crane: Fair enough. I'd like to talk about some weapon modifications.

Rupert: You work for Rais?

Crane: No.

Rupert: Well, I suppose that helps. But I'm waiting for my wife Jasmine to come back. Until she's here, I can't leave.

Crane: Has she been gone long?

Rupert: No. Not long. So, it'll probably be a while before she returns.

Crane: And what about these kids, are their parents... ?

Rupert: Dead, I hope. Every day I'm terrified that one of them is going to look out the window, and see their mother or father shambling down the street.

Rupert: I don't know what I'm going to do when that happens.

Crane: What have you told them?

Rupert: Half-truths, that a dark magic has taken over the city, but that I'm a good wizard, who can protect them. It's the sort of game that doesn't end.

Rupert: Jasmine is better at this sort of thing. Hell, I'm a gunsmith. What am I doing playing this magical nonsense?

Crane: Seems to me you're doing pretty well.

Rupert: Well, I'm not. There's a girl named Alya. She's a diabetic, only her insulin ran out a while ago. Now her blood sugar is sky high.

Rupert: She's dehydrated and exhausted. Jasmine says if she doesn't get some insulin soon, she'll slip into a coma and die.

Rupert: And here I am in this stupid wizard hat, and the kids are waiting for me to cure her with a magic potion. Maybe it's time to tell them the truth.

Rupert: There is no good magic. Only the dark kind.

Crane: Take it easy, Rupert. There's a drug store in town. Maybe I could find some insulin there.

Rupert: Are you serious? Mister, if you could do that, I can't tell you how grateful I'd be.

Rupert: I've got a radio here. If my wife Jasmine comes back, I'll probably go home for a while. But I'll let you know before I leave.

===The Bunker===
Ihsan: If you're looking for food, you've got to wait and get your rations like everyone else.

Crane: That's not why I'm here. I'm Crane. I'm a runner. Anything I should be looking for out there?

Ihsan: We're pretty much out of everything; food, water, medicine. You wouldn't expect Old Town to be poorer than the slums, but it is.

Ihsan: Got to admit, it makes me wonder about those rumors of a big supply cache hidden somewhere in the city.

Ihsan: Too bad the one person who'd know if it's true is Thabit Erdal. You can't get anything out of him.

Crane: Where do I find him?

Ihsan: Across town. He's not dangerous, he's just... difficult. He's the former Town Clerk, and he can be extremely bureaucratic about things. Try not to kill him.

Ihsan: But if you have to kill him, I'll totally understand.

====Thabit====
Thabit: Yes, what is it?

Crane: Are you Mr. Thabit Erdal, the Town Clerk?

Thabit: That was my title. However, all city authority has been dissolved by the GRE and the Federal Government.

Thabit: My title does not exist any more, and therefore I am no longer required - or allowed... to provide any services to you or anyone else. In conclusion, goodbye.

Crane: Not so fast, Mr. Erdal. The dissolution order requires ALL local officials to be at the service of the GRE and the provisional authority, as needed.

Thabit: Are you with the GRE?

Crane: I'm looking for information about a large supply cache hidden somewhere in the city.

Thabit: You mean the bunker.

Thabit: Well, if you wish to take possession of it, you'll have to lodge a 2-0-1 "Needs of Agency" form, J-P-4-0-1 "Details of Operations form...

Thabit: Also, a 6-0-6 "Compulsion of Special Authority" form, and 3-0-2B "Declaration of Emergency Functions" form.

Thabit: That last one has a three day turnaround in the best of circumstances, which these are certainly not.

Crane: I need it now.

Thabit: Well, then I suggest you employ the traditional method of accelerating the government process.

Crane: Which is what?

Thabit: Bribery, of course.

Thabit: I need the official "Seal of the Mayor" embossing stamp. The mayor was last seen at the Hotel. Find his room, and you should find the seal.

====Back to Thabit====
Thabit: (Ahh!) Wonderful! I promise to abuse this Seal to the fullest extent of my corruption - which is considerable.

Crane: Tell me about the supply cache.

Thabit: It was a necessary precaution. Old Town supports a very wealthy class of citizens.

Thabit: They knew the slum districts would exhaust their meager supplies, and that the wretched poor would then invade us like a wave of locusts.

Crane: So you locked it up.

Thabit: The bunker is under the Town Hall. I can monitor your progress on the City Services band.

Thabit: Radio me if you need some paperwork from the office of the Mayor. I'll be generating reams of it.

====At the Bunker====
Crane: Thabit. Are you listening?

Thabit: If you're in the Town Hall, could you filch me some stationary from City Council President's chambers?

Crane: Where's the pass card to enter the bunker?

Thabit: (Ahh!) The pass card, of course!

Thabit: Do to a series of tragic events, the chain of custody of that card has frequently changed, but I believe it finally landed in the capable hands of Police Captain Halim.

Thabit: That's who you need to get it from.

Crane: Why hasn't he opened the bunker himself?

Thabit: Regretfully, Captain Halim's interest in material things is no more.

Thabit: He frequently shambles around K-Street, with several other former police officers.

Thabit: Perhaps they have some vague recollection of their fraternity.

Crane: Thank you, Captain Halim.

====Returning to the bunker====
Thabit: By order of the Mayor, the entire contents of this bunker now belongs to me!

Thabit: Get away from it, thief!

Crane: Ihsan, this is Crane. I'm in a supply bunker, under the Town Hall. I think we hit the jackpot.

Ihsan: That's great news, Crane. Thank you. Did you actually get Thabit to help you?

Crane: Yeah, but I had to kill him in the end.

Ihsan: I totally understand.

===The Shadow of the King===
Crane: Now what happens?

Ishaq: Speak no more.

Ishaq: The rising sun will lead you to the fountain of crying blood...

Ishaq: ... near the place where people are speaking tongues...

Ishaq: you must follow the red trail... to be enlightened...

Ishaq: ... under the deceitful number 9...

Ishaq: The shadow of a self-proclaimed king will be waiting for you...

Ishaq: ... the king, with whom you shall have to fight.

Ishaq: You'll find out who he is and what his weaknesses are. When the time comes, you will take his crown or die.

====At the hotel====
Crane: ... people speaking tongues?

Crane: The hotel would have been full of foreigners. Maybe that's it.

Crane: And there's the red trail. Well, he's either clairvoyant, or I'm being setup.

Crane: The deceitful nine must be a room number then...

Crane: 107 is the last room.

Crane: Deceitful nine. Of course.

Crane: Now how do I find the key in all this mess?

Crane: This was Rais's room. He must have set up shop here when the epidemic first began.

===Troll===
Girl: Are you really leaving?

Crane: I'm afraid I have to, sweety. But some friends are coming to help you guys out. They'll be here really soon.

Girl: What if the troll gets them?

Crane: What troll?

Girl: There's a giant troll down in that parking lot. He makes lots of very scary noises, so it's hard to sleep.

Crane: Well, that's no good. Maybe I'd better chase him away. We can't have trolls in the parking lot, can we?

Girl: No sir.

====At the parking lot====
Crane: Alright, we're all clear out here.

Rupert: Crane, that wasn't the Troll.

Crane: (Wait.) What?

Rupert: THAT'S the troll!

Crane: Of course it is.

Crane: Scratch one troll.

Rupert: Crane? This is Rupert. You're alright?

Crane: Yeah, but kids are a lot more work than I realized.

Rupert: That's the truth. Look, your friends arrived, so I'm turning in my wizard hat and headed back to my workshop.

Rupert: I want you to meet me there. I owe you one hell of a debt and it's time for me to pay it.

Crane: I'll meet you there.

====Rupert's workshop====
Rupert: Glad you made it.

Rupert: You did me a heck of (a) favor back at the Magic Fortress.

Crane: Happy to help.

Rupert: And I'm happy to pay you back, so have a look around. If you see anything you want, it's yours. On the house.

Crane: This will do very nicely. Thanks.

Rupert: Thank you. And good luck, Crane.

==Side Quests (The Antenna)==

===The Launch===
Volkan Dal: Mr. Crane? AM I speaking to Mr. Crane?

Crane: This is Crane. Who is this?

Volkan Dal: This is Volkan Dal. I'm with the brothers. Would you join us at the vehicle assembly facility? I'll provide the coordinates.

Crane: I'll be there shortly.

Crane: You're Volkan Dal.

Volkan Dal: And you are Mr. Crane. You're quite a capable man.

Crane: I get things done.

Volkan Dal: That makes you far above average.

Volkan Dal: Those two, in spite of what you have no doubt witnessed, are no less capable... in their own way.

Crane: A submarine? So, you're trapped here too.

Volkan Dal: Not for much longer.

Crane: You couldn't buy your way out?

Volkan Dal: The government knew I'd been bitten. They said I would have to be stored in some sort of secret quarantine base.

Volkan Dal: That was not for me.

Volkan Dal: Did you bring the sonar unit?

Crane: I have it right here.

Fatin: Ready for testing, Mr. Dal.

Volkan Dal: Excellent. Mr. Crane, do you wish to do the honors?

Crane: Why not?

Tolga: Try not to break it.

====After pushing the submarine====
Volkan Dal: Brilliant!

Fatin: Preparing for test maneuvers.

Tolga: Ballast tanks open. Submerging to two meters.

Fatin: Ahead one third.

Tolga: Oh-no!

Volkan Dal: Gentlemen. I want to know what happened.

Fatin: It blew up.

Tolga: It blew up.

Fatin: It's your fault!

Tolga: It's your fault!

Fatin: Mine?! You are insane!

Tolga: Mine?! You are insane!

Volkan Dal: Yes, of course.

Volkan Dal: Fatin. Tolga. I want ideas!

Tolga: Human cannonball!

Volkan Dal: (Hmm.) Too dangerous.

Fatin: Tunnel to China!

Volkan Dal: Too much digging.

Fatin: Jet pack!

Tolga: Jet pack!

Volkan Dal: Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a jet-pack Build me a jet pack!

==Random Encounters==

===Ahmet===
Ahmet: Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I'm a good guy. Okay?

Crane: (But,) That's not a good guy uniform you're wearing.

Ahmet: I can explain. My name is Ahmet, and two months ago I made a huge mistake: I joined Rais's group. I know it was stupid, but what else could I do?

Ahmet: People said he was grabbing all the Antizin, so I figured it was smart.

Crane: But now you've changed your mind?

Ahmet: Do you know what they're like? They're maniacs! They hack up people for sport. I'm not like that. I had to get away.

Ahmet: But Rais doesn't take well to people leaving. His crews shoot at me on-sight. I want to join Brecken's group, but they shoot at me too.

Crane: So, you want me to help you get to the Tower?

Ahmet: I don't have anything to pay you with, but I know some supply stashes Rais's guys keep in the city. They would be on the way.

Crane: Alight I'll get you there.

Ahmet: Did you know when you join Rais's group, they make you eat a pair of human eyeballs.

Crane: Wow, and you didn't think that was a bad sign?

Ahmet: I was... troubled. But I wanted to fit in. You know?

Ahmet: Ahhh! They've already cleaned this place out. But I know one they don't know about.

Crane: Let's get moving.

(Rais' soldier: Hey, look! Over there!)

Ahmet: It's an ambush!

(Rais' soldier: We've got company!)

Ahmet: Everything is still here. Get me to the Tower and I'll give you your share.

Crane: Let's go.

Ahmet: Two ... maybe three RPG's should kill it.

Ahmet: This is a bad situation. This is really bad.

Ahmet: Spewers, I hate them.

Ahmet: Me against them is not going to work.

Ahmet: I never would have made it without you.

Crane: Do yourself a favor and buy a change of clothes.

Ahmet: That'll be my first purchase. Here's your cut.

Crane: And the next time you have to eat eyeballs to get into a club... find a different club!

===Albert===
Albert: Hey. It's Crane, right? You want some valuable info?

Crane: ... What're you talking about?

Albert: Listen, I'm a civil engineer. I was working out of a firm in Old Town... uh, Sector 0, I guess people are calling it now.

Albert: And you know what we spent all our time on? The sewers.

Crane: That sounds... thrilling.

Albert: Hey, now, there's no need to be sarcastic. Harran's sewer system is a thing of beauty -- If you've got the right eye for it, anyway.

Albert: And you know who SHOULD have the right eye for it? YOU.

Crane: Look, if you've got a point, now would be a good time to get to it.

Albert: Impatient, huh? Can't wait to get out there and kill some zombies, huh?

Albert: They go everywhere under the city. You name a location, we've got a sewer line running about five or ten meters below the surface.

Albert: See, we were able to tie 'em to a bunch of existing caverns! Waste not, want not, am I right? They spread out under Harran in every direction!

Albert: Most of them are much larger than standard sewer lines, too. Makes navigating around them a snap.

Crane: They sound like a great place for zombies to congregate, too.

Albert: Well... no system is perfect, is it?

===Babar===
Babar: We are all in the most terrible danger! Please! Don't ignore me! Listen to what I have to say!

Crane: Just calm down and tell me what's going on.

Babar: I am Babar Kizil, and I am the victim of a most terrible, and ancient curse.

Babar: I am a licken-thrope.

Crane: A what?

Babar: A licken-thrope. A werewolf!

Babar: You have seen the undead all around you. Is it so unlikely that other such monsters are here as well?

Babar: The nosferatu. The mummy. The licken-thrope. Dahlia, the witch, says I can be cured if I ingest a potion of garlic, wolfs bane and a teaspoon of cinnamon.

Babar: Help me collect these things and get me to another safe zone, I will pay you very-very well.

Crane: Why do you need to reach another safe zone?

Babar: One of the survivors here... I think he's a ghoul.

Babar: Also, they tell me I have to leave because I'm a crackpot.

Babar: Tonight is the full moon. We haven't much time.

Crane: Yes, I'd prefer not to drag this one out.

Babar: Look at all these bodies! We must leave before the police get here.

Babar: Garlic. The first ingredient. Good. We can move on.

Crane: You're looking more human already.

Babar: Wolf's bane. The bane of wolves. Now, for the final ingredient.

Crane: Let's go.

Crane: Babar, how did you become a werewolf?

Babar: Oh. Uh... The usual way. Not much to tell.

Babar: There. A teaspoon of cinnamon. I have everything I need. Now, I will cure myself of this terrible curse.

Crane: You may fire when ready.

Babar: Oh my god! BRAAAHAAAAAA!

Babar: Oh! ...Ahh! That was disgusting!

Crane: Yes, it was!

Babar: Okay, I'm cured. Let's go.

Babar: I will attack him... mentally.

Babar: If it was a full moon I could kill them all. But it's not, so I need help.

Babar: How can you kill that which has no life?

Babar: My undead brothers. They don't like me!

Babar: I don't think biting him will have much effect.

Babar: It is the Frankenstein monster. Be careful.

Babar: Thank you, Sir. You have saved countless lives.

Crane: No doubt.

Babar: Here is your payment. Good luck to you. And beware the moon.

Crane: Yep.

===Bob===
Bob: I came in with the Hazmats. Team 4. It was two days before they sealed the city, and our job was to go door to door and find out who was still alright.

Bob: So we'd knock on doors. Sometimes you'd hear a voice that sounded like a person.

Bob: So you'd go in-only it'd turnout it was a viral. All angry and crazy, but just enough voice left to fool you.

Bob: Sometimes they weren't alone.

Bob: The suits are pretty tough. They're PVC, with reinforced, double-layered poly-fibercore. We thought we were safe, but it turned out the biters could chew right through it.

Bob: Sometimes I see some of my old squad shambling around.

Bob: Gets me down to see them like that. You know the funny thing? They're all biters now, but they can't bite-cause they don't have the brains to take off their masks.

Bob: I'll tell you, this whole thing is pretty d*mn strange.

===Damla===
Damla: I don't like American movies. Not anymore.

Crane: Sorry, I didn't hear you -- what'd you say?

Damla: American movies. My mother took me. Always, on Thursday nights, after she got home from work. She would take me and my little brother to the cinema.

Damla: We loved the movies from your country.

Damla: You've Got Mail, The Matrix. Singing in the Rain... especially Singing in the Rain. We loved them.

Damla: We loved Harran, too, but our city was nothing like the sights your films showed us.

Crane: Uh... so... what went wrong?

Damla: Ha. Ha ha. What went wrong? You know what went wrong. Venture outside and it becomes painfully obvious.

Damla: But that is not why I dislike American movies now. I dislike them because they betrayed me. They promised me... how do you say it.

Damla: A "Hollywood ending". Everyone "lives happily ever after."

Damla: There is no such thing. We are born, and then we die, and we never know when or how it's going to happen.

Damla: Your happy stories did not prepare me for that. I wish they had. I wish they had.

Damla: You can keep your Hollywood ending. I must live in the real world now.

===Faruk===
Faruk: Sir! Please! A moment of your time will be rewarded with knowledge and treasure!

Crane: No offense, but you sound like a salesman!

Faruk: But I am a salesman!. I am Faruk Korkmaz, Expert Sales Associate of Zerp Cleaning Products and Services. And I have a wonderful opportunity for you today, Sir.

Crane: (Look.) I don't really want to buy anything.

Faruk: Of course you don't - and I do not want to sell you anything. Except one thing. An idea: You helping me.

Crane: Oh, boy.

Faruk: Sir, I am just three sales short of being Salesman of the Year. That is assuming that with all the death and zombies, we'll be closing-out the year early... which we will.

Crane: Look, I'm pretty busy.

Faruk: We are all busy. I'm busy. You're busy helping me. But these sales are already made.

Faruk: I just have to make delivery of three bottles of Zerp Stain Remover, so I can post to billing. Then the sales are complete, and I am Salesman of the Year.

Crane: Yeah, but...

Faruk: ...But what's in it for you? Glory! What else? Rewards! Yes, some good useful treasure for someone like you. Plus, you get the Zerp Guarantee of satisfaction.

Crane: Alright, Faruk, let's get going.

Faruk: You will not regret this!

Faruk: It's tough-times for sales. It's really death out there, what with all the death and so forth.

Crane: And yet, you soldier on.

Faruk: Hose 'em, and close 'em. That's what I say.

Faruk: Zerp Chemical. Delivery!

Faruk: Perhaps they are out killing someone.

Faruk: I'll leave it at the door. You'll be billed later!

Faruk: Okay, next one.

Faruk: Zerp Chemical. Delivery!

Faruk: Probably out getting Antizin. Hope you find some!

Faruk: Your Zerp is waiting at the door. Also, it's automatic re-order, so you'll get two more bottles next month.

Faruk: Enjoy your stain-free existence.

Faruk: Sometimes they start shooting at me. We should get going.

Crane: (You know,) I usually feel good about helping people.

Faruk: What are you, the Peace Corps?

(Rais' soldier: Hey! You see that?)

Faruk: Thank you, Sir. You are now an honorary employee of the Zerp Chemical Company. Congratulations.

Crane: Uh ... Thanks.

Faruk: Here is your payment. Good luck to you, but stay out of my territory. If I catch you poaching my customers, I'll shoot you.

Faruk: Goodbye.

===Irwin===
Irwin: Crane?! You're Crane, right?! Kyle Crane?

Crane: Yeah?

Irwin: Irwin Snowberg. Movie director. I make the Zombie-annihilation movie series. You've probably seen them.

Crane: (Uh.) No.

Irwin: They're thought-provoking meditation about  people very much like yourself, who have to kill butt-loads of zombies, for various reasons. The details really aren't important.

Irwin: What is important is production cost. Makeup is a major factor. I'm talking head-rot, arms falling off, guts hanging out.

Irwin: And when you blow 'em apart with guns - those squibs cost like crazy.

Crane: So you've come to Harran.

Irwin: It's a tragedy, of course. But there's a fortune in special effects shambling through the streets, just waiting to have their heads blown off for my next movie, Zombie-annihilation IV: Dying Lunch! (Hehehe!)

Irwin: All I need is a gun-nut, who can drop them in spectacular numbers, and I am told you're just such a man.

===Johann===
Johann: I am Johann, and my story is strange but true.

Johann: Do you know why I am here? Because I got too drunk!

Johann: It's a very interesting story.

Johann: My friends, Heinrich and Felix said if I drank enough, I would be immune to the disease, because, you know, alcohol kills the germs. That's science, so that's right.

Johann: Yah, so I make myself completely immune. Okay?

Johann: So, four days later I wake up and the whole city is all ... how do you say ... Locked down! But Felix and Heinrich are gone! Zey are my best friends and zey left me behind!

Johann: And when I looked in the mirror, do you know what I saw? They drew a thing on my face! You know--a man-thing!

Johann: I was so mad. Still am, pretty much.

Johann: So, I'm going to get back at them. But first I must figure out how. Hard to believe, but it's all true.

===Mrs. Braithwaite===
Mrs. Braithwaite: I never expected Harran's destiny to turn out so close to its intention... and yet so far.

Crane: What do you mean?

Mrs. Braithwaite: Harran has always been something of an anomaly. It was originally settled in the Middle Ages but it has always been an open city -- a center of trade and commerce.

Mrs. Braithwaite: Because of that, the prevailing attitude here has consistently been one of tolerance and acceptance.

Mrs. Braithwaite: People of all nationalities, ethnicities, religions, all were welcome within Harran's borders... as long as they could pay the city's taxes.

Crane: Sounds like a good thing.

Mrs. Braithwaite: You would think. And for the most part, it has been -- the aborted Global Athletics Games would have highlighted the city's diversity.

Crane: So why do you sound so down about it?

Mrs. Braithwaite: Because the outbreak has demonstrated what I fear is one of the more fundamental elements of human nature: we divide ourselves.

Mrs. Braithwaite: We divide ourselves, and we look for an enemy. The survivors in the Tower are a diverse lot, it's true, but who are we more frightened of?

Mrs. Braithwaite: The infected? Or Rais and his army of gangsters? And Rais himself -- I'm told his men are just as varied as those of us here.

Mrs. Braithwaite: And yet he sends them against us.

Mrs. Braithwaite: If old lines fade, we draw new lines.

Crane: Okay, well, thanks for that bit of inspiration.

===Murat===
Murat: What went wrong? I don't mean this plague, that must be God. But what went wrong with Harran? When they found the oil, they said it would make us all rich. Everybody.

Murat: They said there would be jobs, but the good jobs went to people who weren't even from Harran.

Murat: They built big towers with air conditioning, but I don't know anyone who works in them.

Murat: For us, they built this slum. That was our reward. That was the gift of oil. Now, the water is not clean, and the air smells like a truck.

Murat: It was not fancy before, but it was not so ugly like it is now. And then this plague came.

Murat: Last month, I saw a man... a rich man - he was being attacked by a peasant woman. I knew her. Her name was Deniz.

Murat: Only she was no longer a person. And this thing that used to be Deniz bit into that rich man's face like it was a watermelon.

Murat: And I was glad. I am ashamed of how glad I was.

===Omar===
Crane: What are you doing out here?

Omar: Digging for worms to go fishing, of course. What else is there?

Crane: Do you want a list?

Omar: No, I want to go fishing!

Omar: I am Omar Boz, and if you will take me to my secret fishing spot, I will reward you with something I couldn't care less about, but you will think is wonderful. Deal?

Crane: Deal. Let's get moving.

Omar: Good. Now we just need to pick up my fishing gear.

Omar: First, I need my reel. It's a Tobunga Mark 12. Super-caster. Take a guess what I paid for it.

Crane: I really don't care.

Omar: Wrong. $275.00 List is $649.00. It was used, but that's still a very good price.

Omar: (Ah!) There it is! I had to pawn it a few months ago.

Omar: But thanks to this epidemic, and the total collapse of civil authority, I can get it back without having to pay for it. What good luck, yes?

Crane: Hurry up, Omar.

Omar: Okay, now I need my rod.

Omar: Do you fish?

Crane: No.

Omar: You should. It is good for your soul. And you can eat them!

Omar: My rod is a Sea Beam, carbon fiber, Flex Master II.

Omar: You haven't asked, but I know you're curious.

Omar: I sold it to my good friend, Rashan, but I think he's some sort of a monster now, so what does he need with it?

Crane: Seems this epidemic is working out alright for you, Omar.

Omar: I am practical, like the fish in the sea. Nothing is all bad... except mosquitos.

Omar: I have seen this one before, it pukes a lot.

Omar: I cannot fish when I am dead! Help me!

Omar: Look, a whale! ... which is not a fish, but a mammal.

Omar: Hello Rashan, I've come for my rod! You better not have damaged it!

Omar: I own over 300 lures, and each one has its own story.

Omar: Would you like to hear them?

Crane: No.

Omar: Your loss.

Omar: Oh no! He wrote his stupid name on it.

Omar: I'll kill him!

Omar: I have everything I need. Take me to the fishing spot, my good friend. The fish, they are summoning me!

Omar: My secret spot is filled with zombies! I cannot fish with them trying to eat me.

Omar: This has been a great experience for you.

Crane: Not really.

Omar: I was going to pay you in fish, but when we were in the pawn shop, I saw this, and thought you might want it instead.

Omar: If you prefer fish, you will have to wait until I catch some.

Crane: I'll take this.

Omar: OK... farewell my friend, and may the fish be with you. Always.

===Richie===
Richie: Hey, I'm Richie, Richie Vandercamp. Obviously I'm not from this part of town. I'm sure you could tell. Right?

Richie: Don't get me wrong, I'm not making any judgments here.

Richie: I own a PR firm, so believe me, I don't make those kinds of mistakes. Best Face Forward, that's my company.

Richie: We were handling all the PR for the Harran Games.

Richie: TV spots, billboards, radio. I'm telling you, we sold this thing big.

Richie: I'm talking solid slots in all the major markets, plus three hour blocks on ESPN 5. Primo! Right? I told the Premier, Harran is going to be on the map now, baby!

Richie: Well, I guess Harran is on the map, alright. What the hell, man! How am I supposed to fix this? It's a disaster!

Richie: Come to zombieland and watch your family get eaten alive.

Richie: You can't smooth that over!

Richie: ... or maybe you could.

Richie: Yeah, I think we could pull it off, it would take a big campaign, and I do mean BIG. But that's what I do. That's why you go with Best Face Forward.

Richie: I don't belong here.

===Yilmaz===
Yilmaz: Crane. You're dealing with Rais, aren't you? You're the one who volunteered?

Crane: Guilty as charged. Something I can do for you?

Yilmaz: I believe I can provide... some context. You may find it useful. You may not.

Crane: Okay. Lay it on me.

Yilmaz: I did not witness this first-hand, so take it as hearsay if you want... but it involves his brother, Hassan.

Crane: I know about Hassan. He died, right? And Rais blames the GRE?

Yilmaz: He is right to. Hassan was confined to a wheelchair... and he was the only person in the world Rais cared about.

Yilmaz: Hassan acted as a tempering influence on his brother. Where Rais wanted to go to war, Hassan convinced him to seek peace.

Yilmaz: And when the outbreak happened, Rais demanded that the GRE evacuate Hassan first and foremost.

Crane: ... And they didn't?

Yilmaz: There was political in-fighting. Because of the Ministry, the GRE dragged their feet... and Hassan died in a zombie attack.

Yilmaz: The GRE could have removed him from harm's way immediately. They elected not to.

Yilmaz: And now Rais has lost his moral compass... free to inflict his brand of sadistic lunacy on the populace of Harran.

Crane: So Rais's beef with the GRE. You're saying he's justified?

Yilmaz: I do not excuse him. He is a vicious gangster. A blight on this city. I merely want to help you understand the enemy you will surely face.

Crane: Understood. ... Thanks.

===Survivors===

====Survivor scavenging supplies (Slums)====
Crane: Hey. What're you looking for?

Survivor: Something I can use for a tourniquet. Once Rais takes this place over, we're going to need plenty of 'em.

Survivor: That's something they do, see? Amputations. Rais gets a kick out of it. Wondering how I know?

Survivor: That m*th*r*f*ck*r kept me locked in a cage for three weeks. I saw plenty.

Survivor: Sometimes it was like he was experimenting... see what'd do the job best. Machete... axe... shotgun.

Survivor: Hell, he took this one guy's leg off at the knee, and had Tahir time how long it took the poor b*st*rd to bleed out.

Survivor: It's a valid strategy. You kill an enemy, well, that's one enemy down. But you HURT an enemy...

Survivor: Then you've got the wounded guy out of the fight, plus it'll take at least two more people to care for him. Three for the price of one.

Survivor: There's value in sadism, I guess. Given the right circumstances.

Crane: (Wow.) I bet you're a lot of fun at parties.

====Survivor dressed up like the military (Old Town)====
Survivor: Now you listen to me and you listen good, son. You think those biters out there are dangerous? Ha!

Survivor: What you got to watch out for is right in here. Locked up. With us.

Survivor: Yeah, I'm talking about people, of COURSE I'm talking about people. You know why?

Survivor: Because people are godd*mn unpredictable. Biters? You know what they're gonna do. They're gonna bite.

Survivor: But you get somebody in here, somebody who's used to living the good life -- somebody spoiled. Pampered.

Survivor: Then all of a sudden they're sleeping on the floor and eating cat food and nobody gives two f*cks who they are anymore.

Survivor: That kind of thing -- and you pay attention to this -- that kind of thing will screw with your mind worse than any zombie.

Survivor: Zombies, that's... that's too strange. Too far out of the human experience. Too far off-script for most people's minds.

Survivor: But somebody who used to live like a king, and now they're worse than a beggar? They understand that. And they're the ones to watch out for.

Survivor: Because they will f*ck*ng snap. In a heartbeat. And you don't have the slightest idea what they're capable of, or what they'll do.

Survivor: So be careful. And keep a weapon handy.

Crane: Yeah, I'll be sure to keep an eye out for homicidal one percenters.

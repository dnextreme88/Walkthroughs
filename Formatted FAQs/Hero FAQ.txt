==Frequently Asked Questions==

*Q - How many items can hero units carry?
**A - They can carry up to 6 items.

*Q - What is the level cap of hero units?
**A - The level cap is 10 and cannot exceed more than that.

*Q - Why do I see this -> "Night Sight: 80 (180*)"?
**A - The normal Night Sight of the Night Elves is 80. When you build a Hunter's Hall and upgrade "Ultravision", all Night Elves units you control will have an enhanced Night Vision during night time. When upgraded to Ultravision, their enhanced Night Vision becomes 180.

*Q - There are some heroes that cannot attack air units. Is it possible for them to attack air units using spells?
**A - Yes. Certain spells such as Mountain King's Storm Bolt can hit air units.

*Q - Are the Hit Points (HP) of the heroes their maximum HP of that level?
**A - Yes. Maximum HP of each heroes increases per level. Refer to the table of that specific hero to know how much increase of HP the hero will have per level. However, if you are gonna wear items like "Periapt of Vitality", it will increase your maximum HP as long as your hero wears the item.

*Q - Are hero names randomly generated?
**A - Yes. Even if you are going to restart the mission, a random name is given to the hero. See the HERO NAMES section per hero to see the list of names your hero can have.

*Q - Could I give a hero another name?
**A - No. That's only possible on World Editor. You can't do that in a normal game. There's a file you have to see in order to edit the names of each heroes.

==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Vehicle FAQ for State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition. This guide will list the different statistics of each vehicle found in the game. I based all of its values on the game's files and I only added color variants and their real-life resemblances (this is as accurate as possible). Few of the vehicles are unique and are only spawned once per game such as the [[Jurassic Junction SUV|Jurassic Junction SUV]]. There aren't really that much variety in the car models present in the game because [[Regular Vehicles|regular vehicles]] come with [[Custom Vehicles|custom paintjobs and branding]].

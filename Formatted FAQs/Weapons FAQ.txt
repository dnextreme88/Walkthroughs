==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Weapons FAQ for Far Cry 5. The guide will list all pertinent details of each weapon found within the game. Most weapons will have different customization options available such as attachments, scopes, skins etc. Certain weapons are also locked and the condition to fulfill them is provided in the guide. Take note that prestige weapons are very unique and powerful so grab them when you have the chance to afford them. Resistance points are earned when completing objectives on all three regions. This does not include Dutch's Island, which is viewed as a introductory region.

|c Extended Magazine |c $920 |c Increases the number rounds in your firearm. You'll be reloading (and vulnerable) less often. |
|c Suppressor Cylinder |c-2 $1,725 |c Makes your firearm virtually silent. Ideal for when you want that "silent, but deadly" thing. |

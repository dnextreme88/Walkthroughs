==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Weapons FAQ for Far Cry 5. The guide will list all pertinent details of each weapon found within the game. Certain weapons are also locked and the condition to fulfill them is provided in the guide. Take note that prestige weapons are very unique and powerful so grab them when you have the chance to afford them.

I will be listing the customizations available for each weapon such as attachments, scopes, skins etc. on the next update. I just need to buy every weapon as I'm currently playing the game at the moment.

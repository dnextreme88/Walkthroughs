==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my File Transcript FAQ for Far Cry 5. This guide will simply list the contents of what each file says and where these files are located in the game. It's worth reading the notes if you come across them throughout your adventures in Hope County as they provide lore and background to the events surrounding Hope County and the cultist movement. I copied the contents of these verbatim, meaning, to how they are worded when viewing these documents, with the exception of some notes as they contain profanity.

With such a vast content of documents to read, I tried my best to get through every location in the game and look at every corner to find any documents I could find. Should I miss some, please help me out and indicate the name of the note, its location and the content of the note (verbatim, word-for-word including capitalization if possible) by sending an email which can be found at the [[Contact Information|Contact Information]] section.

Some of the Eden's Gate followers were spotted in the Silver Lake region again. They've been told time and again they have no permit to build here, yet we've reports of them constructing some kind of small structures. Also, they have been trespassing near the old Roosevelt property. We might need a sterner hand in getting them out of here safely.
=-=

====Story of Woe====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Central Radio Tower. Look for an abandoned truck near the tower. Interact with it and the note is found inside the truck.

=-----=
Mama,

Please don't tell Dad. I don't understand how he can listen to that *ss-hat Father Joseph?? Is Dad joining one of those reaping crews to what, fight our neighbors??

Jack and I stayed out by the Ranger Station where he worked last year. We're ok. We're going away to get married and start a real life.

Armed Eden's Gate folk are everywhere. Please stay safe and try to get dad to see sense.

Love ya,

Mona

===Dutch's Bunker===

====FAITH - THE SIREN====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker. The note is located on the east part of the wooden cardboard on the room where Dutch is waiting for you.

=-----=
Don't know how she's related — seems like she just showed up one day...

She'll spin you a sob story, but Faith is a LIAR and a MANIPULATOR. She'll poison your mind with BLISS if you give her the chance.

Anyone who goes wandering into the Henbane River winds up either dead or "WALKING THE PATH" to become of one of those brain-dead ANGELS doing all the cult's hard labor.
=-=

====Hope County Chronicle Letter====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker, on a short bookcase under an old William & Coleman poster immediately to the player's right as they enter the barracks-style room.

=-----=
October 13, 2014

Dear Mr. Roosevelt,

I'd like to interview you about your recent altercation with government officials over your right to collect rainwater. My understanding is you had applied for a permit, but it was overturned, leading to your nights in jail and ongoing court case.

I'd like to confirm your official statements to the court, that, "Water is a God-given right," and, "The government's stealing our resources out from under us! It's up to us to defend our individual rights and liberties!" Also, did you really tell the judge "Yeah, you bet your lily-white ass I'm in contempt of you!"?

Please let me know if you'll go on the record.

====JACOB SEED - THE SOLDIER====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker. The note is located on the west part of the wooden cardboard on the room where Dutch is waiting for you.

=-----=
Oldest brother of the Seeds. In charge of TRAINING their militia up in the Whitetail Mountains.

Only thing he believes in is "SACRIFICE THE WEAK." Seems to be running a few psychological experiments up north — all sorts of nightmare stories about people turning on one another at the drop of a hat...

Has been linked to the creation of the monster wolves up north the cult calls JUDGES.
=-=

====JOHN SEED - THE BAPTIST====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker. The note is located on the south part of the wooden cardboard on the room where Dutch is waiting for you.

=-----=
Youngest of the Seed brothers and maybe the most sadistic.

In charge of "recruiting for the cult — MARKING, CLEANSING, CONFESSION, ATONEMENT... those are the four steps he puts everyone through to become a member of Eden's Gate — if they survive.

John tells everyone to accept "THE POWER OF YES" as a way to get his followers to do whatever the f*ck he wants. Grade A psychopath.
=-=

====JOSEPH SEED - THE FATHER====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker. The note is located on the north part of the wooden cardboard on the room where Dutch is waiting for you.

=-----=
Leader of the Project at Eden's Gate. He believes a great "COLLAPSE" is coming, and thinks of himself as a modern-day Noah.

Thinks God speaks to him -- told him to SAVE AS MANY SOULS AS HE CAN. Now that he's started the Reaping, his followers are willing to die for him.

He's had his people build three massive BUNKERS to protect themselves when his "PROPHECY" comes true... The guy is an absolute nutjob.
=-=

====Local Fights To Use Water====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker. Found on the kitchen near the white chair.

=-----=
Richard "Dutch" Roosevelt served two nights in jail for contempt of court after contesting his right to collect rainwater in what the state has defined as a reservoir.

"Mr. Roosevelt has operated this rainwater collection without a proper permit, in flagrant violation of Montana laws," said the Water Resource Department deputy director, Edwin Garcia. Mr. Roosevelt is contesting the charges.
=-=

==Henbane River==

===Abercrombie Residence===

====Abercrombie's Note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Abercrombie Residence. Move through the back of the house and find the back door. The note is found near the back door.

=-----=
To everyone looking for me,

The end of the world is coming. The global financial system is going to fall apart and the only person preparing for it is Joseph Seed.

The Project doesn't talk in financial terms, but it's the Collapse all the same. Real estate will plummet, businesses will fail, no one's going to regulate anything... and Eden's Gate knows the real cause of all this: Greed. It's the root of all our problems. For once, I've met like-minded people.

They're hunkering down until it all blows over. If you care for your future, you'll join us.

=-=

====Nadine's to-do list====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Abercrombie Residence. Look for an underground bunker near the house. Descend and you will find the note near the sink and blender to your right.

3. Find the comics he promised me.

3a. Ty not to get killed by the cult.
=-=

===Bright Warden Radon Spa===

====Angel Instructions====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Bright Warden Radon Spa. The note is found just before the mine entrance beside the broken door.

=-----=
I think the Angels like being next to all the best stuff down here. They're happy to stay down here and guard it in the damp, bless their hides. It's like a cupboard that defends itself.

So don't fret about leaving Angels to guard our stash. Lord knows there can always be more Angels.
=-=

===Drubman Marina===

====Marina Note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Drubman Marina. Go inside the open warehouse and move to the back room. The note is located to one of the tables inside this room.

=-=

===Feeney Residence===

====Feeney's note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Feeney Residence. Look for a bunker and descend down. The note is found on a double-deck bed.

=-----=
The techs seem excited about a new strain. I'll be at the Conservatory soon to confirm. Might finally be the one I give my name to. We'll have to celebrate privately rather than in the spotlight of academic publishing I suppose.

I also want to celebrate winning our bet. I'll find some good whisky. Keep the bunk warm.

--Feeney
=-=

===Grimalkin Radon Mine===

====Legal Draft====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Grimalkin Radon Mine. The note is found on top of black boxes on the opened mine during the side mission ''"Blood Dragon 3"''.

=-----=
No humans were harmed in the making of this film. What you see are exceptional special effects employing body doubles we code-named "angels."

They are 100% excluded from any human rights commission coverage.

This film is in full compliance with board regulations etc etc. (Get lawyer to jazz up lingo.)

Sincerely,

Guy Marvel
=-=

====Permit Denied====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Grimalkin Radon Mine. Look for the first house you see that is located on the right. The note is found near a "Far Cry Blood Dragon Poster".

=-----=
Mr. Marvel,

This letter is to inform you that your request to film at the Grimalkin Radon Mine has been refused.

Your application contained insufficient administrative information for our response to be considered.

Furthermore, the Commission cannot approve requests which may endganer the lives of any professionals engaged in filming.

As the location remains radioactive, we cannot condone prolonged exposure of workers to its environment.

We invite you to propose alternative sites within Hope County for your project.

Regards,

The Hope County Film Commission

===Henbane River Station===

====Scribbled Reminder====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Henbane River Station. Check the 2nd cargo. The note is sitting on top of the crate.

=-----=
I'd been homeless once before. Kinda broke the seal on that side of life. Figured when the cult went coocoo bananas I could pick it back up.

No one's gonna "reap" from me if I don't have anything to reap right? They'll just leave me alone.

They just want things, they don't want people. Just gonna. Write that down to remember.

They just want things, they don't want me.

Just things.
=-=

===Hollyhock Saloon===

====S.O.S.====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Hollyhock Saloon. The note is located on the far end of the structure, sitting on the couch.

=-=

===Hope County Jail===

====Earl's notes====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Hope County Jail. Go to the back entrance of the jail and use the door to enter the premises. The note is found on a brown table just before the main hall of the jail cells.

=-----=
Doc Lindsey confirms: NO REVERSAL for angels. No clear process now. Pilgrimage sometime but not always. Sometimes resstance, sometimes civilians. Ritual/tradition break-down under stress conditions? New priorities? No rumors. Means unpredictable point of no return.

Same message: Freeing people must be #1 priority.
=-=

====Note for Virgil====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Hope County Jail. Go to Virgil's office, which is near the infirmary room and check his scrapboard for the note.

=-----=
Dad,

Can I borrow like $100? Or even $80. Just until payday. It's for baseball. Yes I paid the registration fee but this is for extra stuff I didn't know about.

I forgot to tell you I'm gonna try and keep playing. I can pay it back soon.

Thanks,

Ethan
=-=

====Vet's notepad====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Hope County Jail. Enter the jail and just walk up straight all the way to the infirmary. Go to the back room of the infirmary and you will see a table on the right with the note on it.

=-----=
The roadkill test confirmed my worst fear. I don't think a mind can be recovered once it's been overexposed to the agent. Note to self: write up detailed findings later.

I need to do more research to be sure. Maybe if I can't cure the angels I can do something else to help them. Or us.

I'll need more samples of the agent, and biological material it's affected. I have to try. As overwhelming as the day-to-day cases are, this is something I can do. I know it.
=-=

===Horned Serpent Cave===

====Grieving Note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Horned Serpent Cave. Found inside the cave after reading the [[Prepper's Note - The Angel's Grave|Prepper Stash note for The Angel's Grave mission]].

=-----=
Lana, Christ in heaven what they did to you.

The fact they could make you believe all that nonsense, make you forget yourself so hard.

Forget your own name? How, Lana? What did he say to you? What kind of f*cking dirtbag blood ritual could make you think your name was "Faith"?

Doesn't matter how, I guess.

He told you you were special, but in the end he threw your body in here to disintegrate in the boiling muck, like a common Angel.
=-=

===Johnson Residence===

====Johnson Residence Note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Johnson Residence. The note is attached to a brown door at the side of the house.

=-----=
Anybody who reads this,

We're with Joseph's people now, so don't worry about us. He traded our mortgage and credit debts for three square meals a day and a job to do. Not a bad trade if you ask us.

Don't judge a book by its cover, they'll give you a good deal if you join up. So what if you can't take your photo albums and all that? You got your memories inside your head and whatever faith you got inside your heart.

Hope to see you at Eden's Gate.

--The Johnsons

===King's Hot Springs Hotel===

====Dirty Crumpled Letter====

=-----=
You're not the first one, Selena.

You're not the first woman he's used up and thrown away.

For years I'd been hearing this Faith Seed was tall as her brother, with black hair. Couldn't miss her.

And then I saw you in one of their trucks last week, yellow hair in the breeze, and heard them calling you Faith.

He thinks he can just SWAP YOU OUT. Like you don't got a brain of your own.

God knows who you are, and so do you.

Selena, I love you.

Don't lose yourself to this.
=-=

====From a Ghost Hunter====

Location: Found in Henbane River in King's Hot Springs Hotel. Simply walk up to the reception desk and the note is found there.

=-----=
An act of God took the lives of 16 people in this very hotel and they want me to believe there isn't a SINGLE GHOST HERE.

Sure.

This whole county is completely eerie. There's even this wacky cult that owns some of the businesses. Funny little dudes and dudettes.

Hot Springs Hotel is just dripping with paranormal activity - the ectoplasm is even manifesting as mist!

I can't believe no one else in my circles has stumbled on this place. I bet you I can get on TV if I contact the right people!

Who am I gonna call?
=-=

===Lorna's Truck Stop===

====Hear the Word (Lorna's Truck Stop)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Lorna's Truck Stop. Go inside the store and look for pizza stacks inside. The note is beside them. This note is slightly different from the other [[Hear the Word|Hear the Word note found on multiple locations]] as it has slight alterations.

You stay by him, and you'll be all right.

I love you.

Gramps
=-=

====Husband's note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in McClean Residence. Look for a bunker at the backyard of the house. Enter and the note will be found on the table to your right. This note is right after the [[Granddad's note|Granddad's note]].

=-----=
Brent,

We're leaving. Forget the bunker. Eden's Gate knows exactly where we are.

The cult tried to recruit me for the third time. Again, they want me to fly one of their planes and target civilians. Even suggested they might have a problem with law enforcement.

This time, they're forcing me to join in exchange for your safety, given that you join them too and cooperate. No one's allowed to threaten my husband.

That's as far as it goes. We can still prepare fo the next world war. Just not here.

Your Superman,

Travis

====Gas Station Note====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Misty River Gas. Go inside the store and the note will be found on the counter next to the cash register.

=-----=
Dear Mr. McDevitt,

We've received complaints that your Misty River Gas location--a subsidiary of Golden Valley Gas--has been seen with a mounted machine gun on the roof.

It's damaging our corporate identity and our reputation as the leading oil company in Montana.

After reading the [[O'Hara's note: - O'Hara's Haunted House|Prepper Stash note for O'Hara's Haunted House mission]], get inside the barn and make your way through the simple maze. Once you reach the top, look for a small couch and the note will be sitting there.

=-----=

Miss Mable,

Long-time admirer of your work here. Dunno if you know mine. Happy to introduce you. How's your healthcare? Cause if you need anything for your heart or joints or whatever, I can hook you up. I went to college for several semesters. So you know, it's safe.

For you I only I got one asking price: if I kick it before you do, I want to be immortalized. Stuff me! We can talk about pose and final resting place and all that later. Think of how cool it'd be!

Let me know if you're interested. I got some good stuff for rheumatism.. or epilepsy, or cancer, or anxiety. Just in case.

You think this is all about Hamlet but that's only 35.3% of it

I as the student but I'm gonna be the master. I'm closer than ever to ondoing your sh*t

=-----=
Wtf did dad make? Feels kinda like datura but less dry mouth/tachycardia/anxiety and more hallucinations/calm. Higher OD threshold too for sure. Modified jimson weed + additive in refinement? What parts of plant do they use? Consequence of aerosol? Tried tincture leaves + seeds extracted in alcohol, effects similar but not right 100%. More hyoscyamine maybe.

Experiment 22 inconclusive.
=-=

====Tweak's notes #3====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Prosperity. This is the third of four files of the same name. This note is found on the room left of where you found the [[Tweak's notes #2|second Tweak note]].

Betty Betty Betty Betty

...where do I begin? A is for Aaron, and B is for Betty but unfortunately it's also for Brad

Brad, I thought we were mates, pals, blood-brothers, bros

I don't hate you - well, only sometimes - it's just that Betty was my first friend when we moved here.

I couldn't help crushing on her

I know why you fell for her, obv, but it's like a needle full of ketamine to the heart

I mean I want you to be happy but I kinda want for me to be happy more

we'll have to talk about this soon

maybe I can convince Brad to be a superwarrior and take out the cult and die a hero and then--

===Sacred Skies Youth Camp===

====Devoted's letter====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Sacred Skies Youth Camp. Go inside one of the enterable cabins northeast of the greenhouse. The note is found near the sink to your left.

=-----=
August, 2009

Alana,

I went to this place as a little kid and it was HORRIBLE. Campers drank when the counsellors weren't looking. Kids bullied each other all damned day - I swear no one's as vicious as children.

But now? I've never felt so welcome in all my life. So appreciated as I am.

It's a youth group called Eden's Gate. There's no place like it on Earth. I promise you.

Come join! We'll be campers together all over again.

Write me soon,

Ian
=-=

===Seeley's Cabin===

====Do Not Disturb====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Seeley's Cabin. Look for a black door around the cabin and the note is attached to it.

=-----=
A cult doesn't look like a cult when you sign up that's the whole point. Remember that when you say I brought this on myself. I signed up, sure, but I changed my mind and changing my mind is my god-given American right. If they want to hunt me down they can try. They can f*ck*ng try.
=-=

====Moose Psychology====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Seeley's Cabin. Look for the bunker at the backyard of the house. Descend and the note is found on the double-deck bed to your right.

=-----=
Way back when, this moose went all nutty and started running headlong as fast as it could towards a moving train. Guess the conductor wasn't in the mood for mooseberry jam but he has no idea what to do.

This moose is sprinting it's massive lumpy body towards a moving train.

For no reason. Nothing's chasing it. It's just running because something misfired in its big brain.

So I'm about to see some carnage I did not sign up for when the conductor pulls the train's whistle. It's just loud and sudden enough for the moose to toss its head and start sprinting back into the woods.

I've been running headlong into a moving train called Eden's Gate and it's time I get out while I still can.

Bon appetite!

My bunker's useless. I have no choice, I gotta make a run for it. I've heard rumors that someone's started a kind of militia in the mountains up north. Maybe I'll head that way.

If you're readin' this, and you can find your way into my stash, help yourself.
=-=

===Throne of Mercy Church===

====A Confession====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Throne of Mercy Church. Upon entering the church, make a left and the note will be on the table on the far end of this room.

=-----=
I just wanted to be special.

When Joseph came into my life, I felt like you'd given me a true gift, Lord.

That a man who talks to you would bring me in on your holy conversation..?

And so I took the name that you gave me, Lord, through Joseph: "Faith".

And I am a woman made anew.

But now, I'm ashamed to say, even though I carry this name, my devotion to the Project is... plagued. By Doubt.

What do I do? I know you will forgive me, dear Lord. I don't know if Joseph will.

Grace,

We turned Afghanistan into a place people can't come back from.

You ate up every war story I ever fed you. Didn't think you'd follow me.

But you did. Followed so close you surpassed me.

You're a better shot, a better soldier. You're a better athlete and you've got medals to prove it.

You had to fight the same war I did. I never wanted that.

But I'm so proud of you. I couldn't say it to your face.

Turns out I'm not as brave a soldier as I thought.

=-----=
After your wife and child left this Earth we feared for your life. We feared that you had let the weakness overtake you. But you did not. You became the hunter and not the hunted. You gave up sin. You gave up vice and all the evil that had overrun your life. We put our hands upon you and together we took away your sin. We cut it from your chest, just as every member here has also given up their sin.

The Father once told me "No one believes death is coming until the moment it does. And most still refuse to believe it even then." But after everything I witnessed with Mary May and her brother, I believe it.

God forgive me.

=-----=
The uncreative person classifies something as "junk" when they can no longer see a use for it. A person possessing a creative mind will never draw the line between useful item and junk item.

Things are useFULL, not useLESS!

The concept of things being disposable is the only thing manufactured in our world. It was created by capitalists and corporations!

EVERYTHING CAN BE USED TO CREATE SOMETHING ELSE!

=-----=
Les, baby. I don't know what those idiots from Hilgard Electric were so uptight about. You don't need a "degree" in "electrical engineering" or anything else. You an' me built this bunker with our bare hands.

Safety hazard my entire ass.

Didn't I get a smoke detector and a sprinkler system from Red's place last month? We're gonna be fine down here.

I DISCOVERED SOMETHING BIG.

Eden's Gate bought the fertilizer plant I been working at. May have eaten the odd handful of product. Got a taste for it.

One day it tasted different - made me all loopy. Then it hit me: Eden's Gate is spikin the manure!

They fired my ass after catching me with my mouth full.

But I KNOW they're up to no good. I gotta warn people!

Just... how do I tell the town... without telling them about... my cravings.

=-----=
Fall's End is free, but Eden's Gate stole most of the town's food.

Gotta hand it to the bastard: John made a brilliant tactical move.

Without proper nutrition, we won't have the energy to fight. Sounds like an afterthought, until you feel the pain of hunger. It's a hindrance, and adrenaline can onnly fuel you for so long.

I'm sure I can scavenge some scraps and provide something of substance for a little while, but there's a difference between being full and being sated. It's phsychological.

I need to bring back the Testy Festy. It's the only way to guarantee both a full belly and a fighting spirit.

====Mechanic's note====

We're stopping work. No more repairs, not even an oil check.

John's been around with his Chosen.

Don't worry about your job. I'm not firing anybody over this. I'll pay you what I can in the meantime, but stay safe.

If that means being at the garage, fine. If that means being at home, that's fine too. Just don't come around because you think you have to. Something's up.

====Perfumed letter====

=-----=
I'm sorry that I'm having such a hard time lately putting this all behind me. I just don't know how to move forward. It's so hard when I hear from you, and it's harder when I don't. I feel like I'm just waiting for that day when I can see you again - but then what? It'll be back to the same old thing. I really want things to be okay, except I can't figure out what that is for me. And I don't expect you to know. All I know is that what we have isn't love. And it has to stop.

=-----=
After spending so long in a literal prison, you'd think American life would feel...different. Land of the FREE and all that. I got back here and some religious nut was midway through buying my house out from under me. And I fought for that.

I fought for some "John Seed" j*ck*ss to have the "freedom" to legally take my sh*t from me just because some money's changing hands. You can bet I'll never see a dime.

Only thing I brought back from 'Nam was a goddamned lighter. Can't stand the sight of it. Maybe it can do one last thing for me though. Before I go.

=-----=
I never had much faith in the system but this is ridiculous.

When I was growing up the local owned their businesses. One of the perks of living way out here is that no big corporations have their fingers in our sh*t. Nowadays this Seed family owns almost every damned thing in the valley. Moved in silently like a cancer. That family's just about as nice and friendly as the biggest oil corporation you can imagine.

Might as well move back to Misoula.

I can't carry around the guilt anymore. For years I just put it in a box in the back of my heart but it ate away at everything. It changed me.

I need to confess. I need to be heard and...forgiven and absolved.

But I also can't go to prison. I can't I can't I can't I won't I'll die there.

This John Seed man said all I'd have to do is say yes. I could confess, and have this weight off me, and never have to be behind bars.

I'm seeing him tomorrow then. God. I can't wait.

=-----=
The following is important to remember when selecting souls to be saved:

CLEAN SOULS

This is a must. If a soul is tainted by this corrupt world, look into the person's eyes, see if that soul can be redeemed. Each soul must go through the cleansing before being brought to the bunker.

CLEAR MINDS

We need people with intelligence, skills, and talents. Most of all, they must show they can dedicate themselves to building a better world.

ABLE BODIES

Take the healthy. Take the strong. Take the young. Today's children will be tomorrow's mothers and fathers.

====Your Question====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in John's Gate. On the last room before exiting the bunker during a story mission, find the left stairs and look for a long wooden brown table near it. The note is on the table.

=-----=
Terry. My answer is no. I don't think it's hypocritical. To paraphrase Paul the Apostle in Romans Chapter 7, "You know, I do things I don't want to do. The things I should do, I don't do." Everyone's human, and that's why I don't want to put myself on a pedestal. I don't ever want to get back up there again. I'd rather be here with all of you and the new souls in this bunker.

=-----=
Lord, forgive me. For thirty-two years, I have tried to serve you: to protect your house and use it to teach. It seems I no longer can. The people of Eden's Gate want to take the church from me.

They say they are doing your work, but I do not agree with their methods. They misinterpret the Word of God.

There is nothing left for me here. The pews are empty. The candles bear no flames.

I am too old and frail to stop this madness.

Abandoning your house brings me great shame, but alas, I have no other choice.

Funny how it's always the little blowtorch that makes the peggies talk. Think I have all the info I need now. I'll share: They seem to be taking reaped people to the east first, to brainwash them.

Please read this. Eden's Gate has been hounding me for our land ever since you left. Then, the other day, some of them came to the house and told use we've been marked. They said that Ryan was gonna get taken into their Project and that Boomer was gonna be given to a fella named Jacob up North.

Look, I know we've had our differences, but you've left me to be the only one looking out for our boy, and I've decided that I'm standing my ground. There's no way I'm letting those bastards break up our family.

Whatever happens, I hope you understand.

Very important.

Living without worldly possessions ain't what it's cracked up to be

I ain't achieved enlightenment once. Not once!

Honestly, it's getting cold again and I don't think I can survive another Montana winter without a roof over my head.

Them Eden's Gate folks have come by twice now and I can't help but think it's time to just take the free food, clothing, and roof.

All I gotta do is smile and nod through the winter, then I'll just move on down the road. Easy peasy.

I know that some of us in the community have our differences with the Project at Eden's Gate, but I'm hopin' we can look past that.

Nothin's gonna change 'round here. We still run the place, and Joseph's just like our new landlord. Everything's gonna be fine!

For me, my obsession with Bigfoot started when I was a teenager. I had a summer job as a counsellor at a nearby camp. I was in charge of looking after a bunch of 12 year-olds, take them hiking, canoeing, and generally try to keep them alive. We also went out into the woods to do some backpacking and camping out in the wilderness. I'll never forget what I saw that night. We had set up camp deep in the woods and were just about finished our dinner when we heard something large move through the underbrush. At first we worried it could be a bear, but what we saw that night wasn't any like any bear I've ever seen....

It is important to follow these steps when checking if an animal is good for conversion.

1) Injuries — Check the animal for any visible open wounds or signs of distress. If the injuries are relatively minor then treat with an antiseptic and continue to step 2. If the wounds are severe or could cause infection then the animal must be destroyed.

2) Age — Select only fully grown wolves (2 years or older). If they are too young or too old then they must be destroyed.

3) Aggressiveness — Those animals that show aggressive traits seem to have a better chance to survive the conversion process. If the wolf shows no aggressive traits then they should be destroyed.

While he is kept to a strict diet of berries and fish, from time to time we'll sneak him his favorite snack: cheeseburgers.

Now because of his emotional attachment to humans he could never be released back into the wild. Instead, he has become one of the most beloved residents of the Center.

====Cult Sermon====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Grand View Hotel. The note is located on the first floor, on the center wooden table near the cash register.

=-----=
To pass through the Gate you must SACRIFICE something of yourself, to let go of the past and fully embrace your future with the Father. It has to have meaning. What is it that is keeping you here? What is it that anchors you, that prevents you from giving yourself freely to the Father? Is it your husband, your wife, your child? Maybe your brother, or mother? Once you have rid yourself of the shackes of your old life then you can open your heart to the Father's voice.

=-----=
Our Father, my brother, has seen the end of the world, and we're not ready. No one is ready. We have polluted our minds by letting the pathetic sycophants that run our government support those that can't help themselves. They are our anchors, holding us back.

We spend so much effort to lift them up that instead they are dragging us down. It is time we cut the chaff from the wheat, to cull the herd, once and for all.
=-=

=-----=
Hey Mike,

Knew you'd come after me. You're picking the wrong side, buddy.

I miss being a SAR as much as you do but Joseph is the wrong person to take orders from. There's a group up north, supposed to be real skilled. They could use trained people like me. And like you.

Don't make this into some Fox and the Hound bullsh*t. If I see you wearing their colors I WILL shoot. But I'm hoping you'll wise up before then.

I miss you, man.

===MCA Mobile Lab===

====Journal Entry - Day 134====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in MCA Mobile Lab. The note is found outside the tent beside the trailer. You can read [[Journal Entry - Day 140|another journal entry note]] that is inside the tent behind this note.

=-----=
Eli, one of those Whitetail Militia, came by last night. He was trying to convince us to get out of Hope County, that these "Eden's Gate" people meant us harm, I told him that our work here wasn't finished, that it would still be a few days before we could leave. He said "for such smart folks we were acting like a bunch of idiots" and stormed off.

I'm pretty sure he's just paranoid like all the other folks in this park. I mean, who would come after a bunch of conservationists?
=-=

====Journal Entry - Day 137====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in MCA Mobile Lab. The note is found outside the tent beside the trailer. Look for a table with an electric stove on it.

=-----=
It's been two days and still no sign of Howie. He went out for some samples and never came back, and now there's some strange howling from deep in the forest. I'm starting to worry that Eli was right and we should've left when we had that chance. I've seen more of these Eden's Gate people driving around in their white trucks, but we stay hidden anytime they come this way. Bailey and Kent want to try and make a run for it. With the increased Cult presence I don't know if we'd make it. Godammit, I'm a scientist, I'm not cut out for this.
=-=

====Journal Entry - Day 139====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in MCA Mobile Lab. The note is found on a table just before the trailer.

=-----=
We were attacked last night by ... something. They got Kent first, dragged him away to who knows where. Bailey got bit on the leg, it looks pretty bad. We'll try to get to a hospital in the morning. Not sure what attacked us. I'd guess it's some sort of canis loupus, but they've been changed somehow. From the red markings on the forehead I'm pretty sure whatever did that it's man-made, but what sort of chemical/biological compound could produce such a result? I have some theories but I'll need better samples to figure this out.
=-=

====Journal Entry - Day 140====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in MCA Mobile Lab. The note is found inside the tent beside the trailer, near a small laptop. This is just behind the [[Journal Entry - Day 134|journal entry note]] you found on the outer table.

=-----=
I had to bury Bailey today. The bite must've nicked an artery or something... she lost so much blood. I was with her in the end... I was there, holding her hand, and then she was gone. I know I'm not much of a soldier, but I'm not going to let their deaths be in vain.

I might not be good with a gun, but I can help Eli and his Whitetails another way. I'm going to science the sh*t out of these... what did Eli call them? "Judges". With the right data, I can make a difference... all these deaths won't be for nothing.
=-=

===McNeill Residence===

====Research Notes====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in McNeill Residence. Destroy the boarded planks on one of the windows at the back of the house and enter inside. Look for a workbench and the note is there.

=-----=
While the Canis Lupis seems to be the best candidate for augmentation, I suggest testing our formula on other species to see if we can't get a similar result. Here is my short list of potential candidates:

1) Moose - Alces alces

2) Cougar - Puma concolor

3) Bear - Ursa Arctos Horribilis

The nearby FANG Center has a tamed bear we could use if we can get our hands on it.
=-=

===Nelson Residence===

====Fisherman's Note====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Nelson Residence. Go inside the trailer. Look for a white table. The note is sitting on top of it.

=-----=
Cult took everything I ever loved. Only stuff they didn't get was what I stashed in the cave across the river. If I'm gonna die so soon, that means all that really mattered during my time on earth was enjoying myself.

I'll be out there, fishing in the peace, until I can't no more. Hedonism at its best.
=-=

===Old Sun Outfitters===

====Closing notice====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Old Sun Outfitters. The note is found on a red door.

Eli

We can't stay anymore, it's too dangerous with all these cult patrols around. I'm taking my family and we're leaving tonight. That stuff I was holding on for you is outside, in the usual spot underground. Sorry, Eli, but I have to think about what's best for my family.

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Eden's Gate Greenhouse. Enter the first tent to your left upon entering this area and you will see the note attached to a wooden platform inside.

=-----=
The flowers have taken to the Henbane River well. Acres and acres of land are now flush with our special crops.

It's time for us to expand our gardens into the Holland Valley. With hard work, and the grace of God, we'll turn the whole county into an ocean of Bliss. And then no living creature need ever know fear again.

It's a lofty dream, but the Father believes in you. I know we can do it!
=-=

====Chemist note (Jessop's Observatory)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Jessop's Observatory. Go to the 2nd floor of the observatory and you will find the note on the table near the electric fan.

=-----=
Samples 7, 9, and 12 from this week are ready for Dr. Feeny's analysis. Watch the dates on the labels so we won't have a repeat of last week.

Tidy the workspace before he comes. His expertise makes him irreplaceable. His standards are fair so we need to meet them.
=-=

===Chemist's Note===

====Chemist's Note #1====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Nolan's Fly Shop. This is the first of two files of the [[Chemist's Note #2|same name]] found on the same location. Look for a boarded house near the shop. It's near the watchtower. Go inside after destroying the plywood and the note is on the table.

=-----=
The processed flowers we received from the camp have to be distilled into something better.

We've repurposed an old brewery, a place made for gluttony, addiction, a springboard for sin.

The Bliss cleanses our souls, and the Project cleanses the real world.

All is as it should be.
=-=

====Chemist's Note #2====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Nolan's Fly Shop. This is the second of two files of the [[Chemist's Note #1|same name]] found on the same location. Found during the side mission ''"Our Better Angels"'', you must get the key to the basement of the shop. Simply descend down and go straight all the way. The note is located on one of the tables to the north of the last room.

=-----=
If I wasn't convinced of divine science before I surely am now.

Bliss, a chemical compound, made from God's good Earth, makes such perfect workers of the Angels.

Any other person... and I use that word sparingly with Angels, would get sick of all that repetitive labour. Angels are happy to carry Bliss barrels from the brewery, everywhere, back and forth, all damned day. Divine chemical. Just divine.
=-=

====Chemist's Note (Gethsemane Greenhouse)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Gethsemane Greenhouse. Look for a black door near the compound and the note is attached to it.

=-----=

Protect these flowers well.

Praise Faith, Praise the Father.

Go to the warehouse and look for a white table. The note is found there.

=-----=
Powdered Bliss is only made by Faith's private chemists in her Gate.

Liquid Bliss has a better Resurrection rate for the Angels saturated with it.

Sure, the powdered stuff is more powerful, but you knock a body down on that stuff it's not getting up. Angels need LIQUID Bliss because only liquid can reliably get them back on their feet.

Trust in Faith, trust in the Angels.
=-=

===Cult Note===

====Cult Note (Catamount Mines)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Catamount Mines. It is near one of the boxes you'll rig with explosives during the side mission ''"Blow Their Mine"''.

=-=

====Cult Note (Deer Tiger Mine)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Deer Tiger Mine. The note is inside a small shed just beside the tower.

=-----=
Bliss is allocated to certain places for a REASON. It's vital we keep the Bliss we need for after the Collapse separate from the Bliss we're using for Angels and the water supply.

If someone comes round asking for a few spare barrels, always get word from Faith first.

And keep an eye on whoever's asking.
=-=

====Cult Note (Elk Jaw Lodge)====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Elk Jaw Lodge. Inside the cabin, look for the counter on the main entrance. The note is found there next to the TV.

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Kestrel Cabin. The note is found on the red door of the cabin.

=-----=
To all you so called Whitetail Militia, this is your final warning.

Either you join us of your own free will or you will be butchered, one by one if we have to.
=-=

====Cult Note (McCoy Cabin)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in McCoy Cabin. Go inside the house and locate the fireplace. The note is on top of it.

=-----=
The New World is going to be a blissful one. Have you SEEN all the good Bliss has done to this world, even at the end of it's life?

We'll need plenty of it in the world to come, since we don't even know if we'll be able to grow our plants in the dirt when we can finally come out of the Herald's Gates. We need to save these barrels for the collapse. There are enough in circulation for the Angels, the water, the animals.

This batch goes to the bunkers. Guard it well.
=-=

====Cult Note (Sacred Skies Youth Camp)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Sacred Skies Youth Camp. Go inside the greenhouse and the note is found at the back of one of the plants.

=-----=
God sent those Christian campers to this place to sanctify the soil.

Children living here, sleeping here, singing praises to God all those years ago, strengthened the soil.

I'd bet my soul on it.

We were always meant to sow our crop here. Don't forget that.

Guard this land like it is the cornerstone of Eden itself.
=-=

====Cult Note (Silver Lake Summer Camp)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Silver Lake Summer Camp. The note is attached to a wooden board of the house, under an "INFORMATION" signage.

=-=

====Cult Note (Steele Farm)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Steel Farm. The note is hung to a door, on the trailer car near the house.

=-----=
Here hangs a sinner by the name of ALEX. He and his friends came to Hope County with the idea to expose us.

Despite this, the Father forgave him, and chose to save him. How did Alex repay this kindness? By a misguided attempt to free other devoted and lead them through this tunnel.

John's wrath was swift, and the Chosen brought this tunnel down around them. Let this be a lesson for you all.

Don't be like Alex.
=-=

====Cult Note (Strickland Farm)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Strickland Farm. It is inside a metal box just ouside the farm.

Location: Found in Henbane River in Deep North Water Treatment Plant. Look for the warehouse with a "DEEP NORTH" signage into it and the note is found near the door.

=-----=
Priority Notice!

Run the calculations again. We underestimated the bliss dilution in the water system. We need more volume or a more condensed product.

The longer we make mistakes, the longer the unbelievers suffer without the bliss. Focus on fixing this.
=-=

====Cult Orders (Green-Busch Fertilizer Co.)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Green-Busch Fertilizer Co. Get inside the fertilizer store warehouse and look for a computer desk with a monitor. The note is beside the monitor.

Joseph's going to be so proud of us.
=-=

====Cult Orders (Howling Cave)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Howling Cave. The note is located on a giant area where the cultists have caged the wolves in.

Wounds — Are there any visible and open wounds?

Temperament — Is the animal still aggressive, or are they lethargic?

Age — How old is the animal? Remember, too young or too old and the treatment won't take.

Make sure this information is given to the Scientists at the Lodge upon delivery.
=-=

====Cult Orders (The Misery)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in The Misery. The note is found on the workbench on top of the boat.

=-----=
I know this is hard. It hurts to hurt. But we're giving the unbelievers a last chance to tell us how to save our project, to save everything.

They want to help. They just need pain to give them permission to betray the people they think are their friends.

Don't worry, the bliss will wash away your pain when you've finished serving the Father this way.

With love,

Your Priestess
=-=

====Cult Orders (Rae-Rae's Pumpkin Farm)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Rae-Rae's Pumpkin Farm. Look for the cage where the dog is.

=-=

====Cult Orders (US Auto)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in US Auto. It is located on the garage.

=-----=
Brothers and sisters,

Now that we've occupied this garage we must immediately turn our attention toward our defenses.

Half of us will bolster our convoys while the other half will begin work on The Revelator.

This specialized truck will serve as a powerful deterrent to those who oppose The Father.

If we're to have any chance of protecting the devoted from the Resistance, we need to get The Revelator on the road as quickly as possible.
=-=

===Cult Shrine===

Location: This note is found on two locations of Dutch's Island: Forest Research Station and Johnson Lookout Tower.

=-----=
The Reaping has begun. The Father has commanded us to raise these shrines throughout the region to spread his word.

We build these shrines so the Father's wisdom will take root and grow.

For Eden's Gate.

====Handwritten Note (Lansdowne Airstrip)====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Lansdowne Airstrip. The note is attached to the white door of the hangar.

Russ,

There's something rotting up there on the roof. I saw one of them eagles perched on the nearby radio tower with something in its claws the other day.

Dan

You have to understand, we just couldn't wait any longer. Those damn Eden's Gate people came again, and we knew this was our last chance to get out of here alive. Remember that place we talked about? If we make it past the checkpoints that's where we'll meet up.

I pray to God you're okay, and we'll see you soon.

- Cindy

I know you don't understand, and I forgive you. You listened to the Father's words, but you didn't really hear them. Eden's Gate has shown me exactly what I've been missing in my life: a purpose. Thanks to the Father I know now what I need to do, what I need to become. I would have preferred to have taken this journey with you, but now I know that can't be.

We all have to make sacrifices.

Love always - Mark

April 27, 2015

Dad,

I got your message. Good to hear they're dropping the charges. We'll try to come out for part of the summer—Ricky wants to show you how he's riding without training wheels—but Anne's got a lot of work at the college.

I know how much it means to you, so we'll try... only, please lay off the homeschooling talk, okay? It's not right for me or Anne, and the school in South Street is one of the best.

And let's keep the "prepping" activity to a minimum. I know Ricky loves it, but it freaks Anne out.

Talk soon,

Robbie
=-=

====Letter to Dutch #2====

Location: Found in Dutch's Island in Dutch's Bunker. This is the second of two files [[Letter to Dutch #1|of the same name]]. This is found on top of the main workbench in Dutch's locked armory, and can only be accessed after taking Dutch's key from his safe.

=-----=
Jan 20, 2016

Dad, we aren't gonna be visiting anymore. Last time was the last straw.

We said we didn't want Ricky shooting, but you just won't listen. He could have killed himself!

My son isn't going to grow up thinking the end of the world was right around the corner. He's five and he's having nightmares about nuclear war! What the f*ck is wrong with you? I thought we were past this, but you never change.

Anne's taken a job down in Texas, and I'll be able to find work down there easy. I won't be sending you our address.

I'm sorry, Dad. I hope someday you can find the help you need.

=-----=
The Collapse is upon us.

John wants us to pack as much as the Bliss-infused fertiliser as we can into this silo.

Be careful when you handle it, it's very explosive.

Together we will march to Eden's Gate!

===Resistance Note===

====Resistance Note #1====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in Wellington Residence. This is the first of two files of the [[Resistance Note #2|same name]] found on the same location.

We threw up some makeshift barricades and dug in for a firefight, but they sent down... I don't know who or what these Peggies are, but they're monsters.

We keep shootin' them, but they keep getting back up. We can't call for help down here.

God help us all.

I stayed at my post for a while. No action. Leaders are being paranoid, all this place needs to guard it is those bones there (I didn't do it).

I'm heading back to the County Jail. If you're against Eden's Gate and looking for safety that's a good place to start.

====Slightly charred note (Elliot Residence)====

Location: Found in Whitetail Mountains in Elliot Residence. Go inside the house and immediately turn right. The note is found on the dresser table.

I know you warned us, but now it's too late. We thought we could handle it, but we had no idea the resources that Jacob would bring to bear. But we will not give up. This is our land, by God, and no one, not the Government, the army and sure as hell not some religious nutcase is going to drive us off. If nothing else we'll take as many of them with us as we can.

Dear Matt,

I'm so sorry we couldn't convince you and Ann to make the big move and join us out here. I think you would have found the air bracing, and the quiet mornings restful for the mind.

And of course Father Joseph's words are food for the soul. Maybe bring the kids out later in the year. I'm sure the quads would love it, and Marty is old enough to join Jacob's training program.

May the Father bless you.

Don't you fret.

=-----=
It's not just the food. They're brainwashing through entertainment too. Movies, TV, Video Games. Why do you think everything is the same? Everything a sequel? It's all propaganda. Amongst the goblins there's a think tank of 7 ultra liberals that write everything. They create templates and then send them out to companies. The companies will then plug in their corporate mascots, add in some product placement, and sell you the same thing you watched last week only slightly different. The Furious TransAvengers Wars 8 or what have you. If someone tells you they're a Hollywood screenwriter you punch that liar in their goddamn mouth.

====Zip's Newsletter (Puma Mine)====

Location: Found in Henbane River in Puma Mine. Found on a table inside the house.

=-----=
Notice anything funny when you're out in the woods? No baby animals. The Bliss has turned all animals homosexual. Dogs, cats, woodland creatures, and farm animals alike. Even the god damn frogs. None of them are reproducing anymore and it's havin' all kinds of side effects. Wolves are attacking humans. Steers are becoming super aggro, and the frogs....the frogs are having massive org**s. And before you got bent out of shape, I've got no problem with homosexuals. My brother is a homo. He's a great man with a wonderful family. There is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but there is something wrong with pumpin' chemicals into the air that turns ALL animals gay. It's unnatural. I can't go to the swimming hole anymore because it's a god damn gay bathhouse for frogs. These peggie demons must be stopped.

====Zip's Newsletter (St. Isidore School)====

Location: Found in Holland Valley in St. Isidore School. Go inside the school bus and the note is just beside the driver's seat upon entering the main entrance.

=-----=
Let me ask you something. You see any kids around here? Don't you think that's strange? I've been talkin' about it for years, but nobody listens. You know why that is? Baby Farms. It's all the rage in silicon valley. They're growing baies just to harvest them for body parts. I've seen it with my own eyes. Elon Musk has his personal farm half hour north of here. Terrifying stuff. Even worse is what they do with the unhealthy babies. The unhealthy ones are sent to the pits. The ultra elite love to gamble on baby pit fights. They attach little scalpels to their tiny hands and the babies have a Battle Royale until only one stands. I wouldn't have believed it myself, if I didn't discover the boxscores coded in Oprah's book club. Those poor poor babies.

My dear, if you're reading this you must think I've abandoned you. The crash knocked you out cold, and nothing I did could wake you up. I didn't want to leave you, but I have to go find help. The Cult's watching the roads but I think there's a way up by the falls. There's no way I can carry the lockbox but I got the key with me so those f*ck*rs can't open it.

Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

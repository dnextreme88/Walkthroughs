Hi and welcome to my Collectables Transcript FAQ for Dying Light. This guide
will simply list the contents of each collectables found in the game and where
they are located. It's worth reading these items if you come across them
throughout your adventures in Harran as they provide lore and background to the
events surrounding Harran and the virus outbreak. I copied the contents of
these verbatim, meaning, to how they are worded when viewing these documents.

Some transcripts contain profanity and these are filtered.

Bento,  I understand that you said sometimes the drugs
don't work as well as they should.  But when we started
doing business, maybe one out of five pills didn't work
right--like they would do nothing.  Then later, it seemed like
one out of three pills didn't do anything.  Then half of them
did nothing.  I don't really understand what the "placebo
effect" is, but it's not working for more and more of my
customers. If you could increase the placebo levels in
these medicines I would really appreciate it!

Anyway, it's great that you can now produce Antizin in your
own lavatory.  I'm sure the quality control will be much
better.  Glad to be in business with you. We're going to
make a lot of money, and help people too!   Yusuf.

NOTICE TO ALL SHOP KEEPERS FROM RAIS


Warning! The brothers Nazim and Osman are known
thieves who have stolen from me.
Anyone who attempts to trade or barter with them will be
considered complicit, and they will meet the same fate that
awaits these two miserable traitors.


My men will be coming to your shops to inspect your
goods. If any property stolen from me is found in your
inventory, you will be held responsible.  All of your
possessions will be confiscated and your shop will be
burned to the ground.


REMEMBER, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY US
IMMEDIATELY IF YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE EITHER
OF THESE MEN IS IN YOUR VICINITY!

I need to get to Old Town. I've heard it can be done, but you

I'm not a chump, so don't try to con me.  But if you're for

at The Tower.

Are you tough? Are you strong? Are you having trouble
reading this? If the answer to all of these is yes, we may

To Mr. Dawud Togan,

My name is Esma Kayah.  Despite your recent denials, I
am very sure you remember me.
Three months ago I brought in a sterling silver tray which
was used as collateral for a small loan from you (pawned,
as you say).  The amount you gave for the tray was... not
satisfactory, despite my pleas that it was worth far more
than that.  Still, I accepted your money because I needed it.


I was told that I could have the tray back as long as I paid
you double the amount you had loaned me within three
months.  This was always my intention as the tray has
been in my family for nearly one hundred years and was
engraved with my family's letters. It was very precious to
me.


Last week I came in to recover my tray, but it was gone,
and you denied any knowledge of it.
Obviously, you have melded it down for its silver, which
would be worth far more than the money you wanted me to
pay for it.
I don't know what recourse I have.  My receipt shows only
the money you gave me, without any mention of the tray.  I
don't understand how you could do this to me.


I cannot afford a lawyer, so I must let this go.  But you
have not won.  God will deal with you.

To: Dawud Togan

From City of Harran Police Department.


Mr. Togan: Your request for a firearm permit has been
declined again.


The Harran Police Department recognizes your legitimate
concerns as a shop owner to protect yourself and your
business.  However, our concern is public safety, and the
law in this regard is clear:  As we've explained repeatedly,
your history of domestic violence and minor public
altercations disqualifies you from owning a firearm.  Unless
these facts can be refuted this decision cannot be
reversed.  If you have further questions, you may contact
our office.


Signed,  Capt. Enver Halim.

To Police Captain Halim.

Harran Police Dept.


Dear Captain Halim,  My name is Cari Sener, and I'm writing
because I've become very concerned about a man I've
seen in our neighborhood lately.  His name is Salim.  I do
not know his last name, but he lives in a house a few streets
away.  He is a strange man, who often leers at women and
young girls passing by.  One day, a few weeks ago, he
followed me all the way up to my home.  I am certain that
he was following me, and I could feel his gaze at my back.
Then, last Tuesday, he suddenly stepped in front of me on
the path and said, "Would you like to perform for me?"  I
don't know what he meant, but it was very upsetting.


I am told that he keeps very late hours working in his
basement, and that he's known in town for buying many
chains and locks, and often asks the clerks odd questions
about the strengths of the chains needed to restrain a
human being.  I realize none of this amounts to a crime,
but that is surely where it will end.  Please send someone
to talk to him.  Thank You,  Cari Sener

Gursel--  Final warning.  Excuses don't cut it with Tahir, so
they don't cut it with me either.  You can't tell me "it's just
not working".  You have to make it work.  You're in charge,
so it's your job.  The fishermen don't want to pay tribute?
Are you kidding me?  Get your people in line, Gursel.  That
little village of yours could become a smoldering ruin in a
few hours.


You say your people don't think they need our protection?
Don't they get it?  The one thing we can protect them from
is us, and believe me, they need protection.  Tahir takes a
real dim view of this kind of problem.  He likes to make
examples.  Do something--anything!  But get your people in
line, and do it fast --Karim

Hey Asif--


Guess what I just bought?  Right, a new fishing rod!  Okay,
it's not new, but it's a Sea Beam, Flex Master II, and it's in
great shape.  I bought it off Omar Boz for $65.  Guess he
needed some fast cash.  He also just pawned his reel,
which is a really great reel, but I'm still happy with my
Whirlwind 650 Blue Knight, so I'll let that one go ... for now.


As for the rod, I'm putting my name on it.  I wish I didn't
have to, but if I don't, Omar will be whining on my doorstep,
trying to make me sell it back to him for half-price.  But
with my name on it, I might as well have snapped it in half.


Anyway, we need to go fishing soon, but I'm a little under
the weather now.  This weird kid bit me the other day, and I
think it's made me kind of sick.  Should be up and around
soon enough.


Hope this thing isn't contagious!  --Rashan

To whoever now has the task of keeping the juice running
in the city: My name is Mustafa, and I've been maintaining
this system for the past two years. This is my last day. I'm
getting out of here before everything melts down, which I'm
pretty sure is just about to happen.


If you're in here, then the power has gone out. God help
you. If you're wondering why it went out, just picture a
single wall outlet with 20 power strips hanging off it,
running ten refrigerators and a bunch of TV's. That's what
this city is. Now, they want to add the Infamy Bridge to it?!
I've upgraded the capacitors, but we've still got large areas
of the slums that are packed with grid-leeches (non-paying
users of electricity). It's never going to hold up.


The military should go house to house, and remove the
leeches from the grid, but that's not going to happen.
Suleiman says the problem will solve itself, as fewer and
fewer healthy people remain. But he's assuming that all the
infected will shut off their lights and TV's just before losing
control of themselves. Fat chance of that.


And since you're here reading this, that pretty much proves
me right. So, here's my next prediction. You're not going to
get out of here alive. It's too late. Sorry, my friend, but you
haven't got a prayer.

From: Acting Governor, Colonel Kadir Suleman

Harran Emergency Central Command.


To: Major Khalim Abbas, Military Engineering Division.

Subject: Infamy Bridge Firewall Reliability.


Lt. Major Abbas,


You seem an able enough man, yet you continue to take up
my time with things that I've already dispensed with. Have I
been unclear? Despite my previous messages, you remain
convinced that I do not understand the implications of the
current situation. I assure you I do.

As you've repeatedly stated:


1) The Infamy Bridge Firewall requires a great deal of power
to remain operational.


2) The electricity being drawn from the slums districts is of
poor quality and prone to voltage fluctuations that often fall
below the tolerance specifications of the equipment.


3) This under-voltage will rapidly degrade the special UV
lamps being used, resulting in an unsustainable bulb failure
rate.


4) Ultimately, the entire system will fail at an unpredictable
time. This will automatically trigger the failsafe demolition
charges, and the bridge will be destroyed to prevent a
quarantine breech.


Which brings me to the point you keep trying to make:
Since we cannot know when the system will fail, we will
not have enough time to withdraw our forces from the city before
the demolition of the bridge occurs. It is therefore inevitable
that we will be trapped in Harran, along with the infected.
Many of us will become infected. Many will die needlessly.


I understand all of that.

Are we clear now?


Suleiman.

It's good news/bad news, my friend. As you know, the
supply of phenyl-nitrate has been running out. None of my
suppliers have seen any for weeks, and they're all saying
the well has run dry for good. I even had one of my
informants at The Tower check if they're sitting on any in
their medical facility (apparently, phenyl-nitrate can be used
as a disinfectant--what a waste!), but they've been out of it
even longer then I have. So, that's the bad news.


The good news is that I've found a source. I've traced a
missing case of phenyl-nitrate to a Zerp Cleaning Products
salesman who had to ditch a delivery he was making on
Chaos Night (you know, when the bridge was blown up).
I've sent my courier to go retrieve it. If he doesn't get killed,
you'll soon be the only guy in town producing Slam, so I
suggest you adjust your prices accordingly. Cha-ching!


In return, I hope you will reconsider taking care of my
problem. You know what a terrible situation I'm in. I'm still
willing to split the recovery with you. Please consider this.
--Aziz.

If you're expecting special treatment, you're not going to
get it.  We need a reliable supply of Slam to keep things
running smoothly around here.  You are one of our
suppliers, so you have value to us.  If you're not a supplier,
then you are not valuable to us.  You should know by now
that falling out of favor with Rais is just about the worst
thing that can ever happen to you. 


Yes, I know Phenyl-Nitrate is hard to find. Maybe it's even
impossible to find.  But that's your problem.  If you can't
cook slam, then come up with something else.  If you can't
come up with something else, you'd better sprout some
wings and fly yourself out of here.  The last delivery was
late, and the one before that was short.  This time you're
late, and now you're telling me you're going to be short too.
So I'm telling you, you're falling out of favor.

Miss Dahlia,


My name is Aruba Ozek, and as you should recall, I
commissioned you to make one of those special dolls of
yours.  It was of my husband Olcan, and its fabrication
required some of his hair, a finger nail, and a drop of his
blood.  I hope this rings a bell for you, as you did not
provide me with a proper receipt, or bill of sale (I suppose
this and your cash-only policy is to avoid paying taxes).


In any event, despite the doll's extremely poor rendering of
Olcan's actual features, its functionality has proven
reasonably good.  Rapidly jabbing a hatpin into its temple
reliably produces an associative "shattering pain" in
Olcan's head, while another pin thrust into the stomach
area produces something he describes as an "abdominal
rupturing" sensation.

I am generally satisfied with these results.


However, yesterday I attempted to improve the effect by
replacing the hatpin with a 16 inch  carving knife.  Holding
the doll in one hand, I thrust the knife into the doll's
stomach--but the blade passed through its poorly
constructed torso and went through the palm of my hand.
My husband heard my scream over his own noisy wailing,
and he crawled into the kitchen to find me standing there
with a voodoo doll of him spiked onto my hand with a
carving knife.

Now he blames me for his pain!  Thanks a lot!


I know owner's manuals are a thing of the past, but you
should provide some documentation and warning of your
product's poor construction quality.  I'm afraid you've lost
an otherwise satisfied customer.  --Aruba Ozek.

Telecode Secured Transmission #21040135695[]

Attention: Erol Asani, Governor of Harran.

Urgency Level:  Maximum


:BEGIN MESSAGE:


This a critical GRE communique:  We can now confirm that
the anti-viral drug Antizin has proven an effective inhibitor
of the Harran Virus.  While not a cure, regular
administration of Antizin will prevent the onset of the most
serious effects associated with the Harran pathogen.


The GRE is working with several pharmaceutical
manufacturers to ramp up production of Antizin to meet the
urgent needs of the Harran people.  Beginning at 14:30 this
afternoon, most GRE support airdrops will now include
Antizin, along with basic supplies.  Detailed instructions for
proper dosage and use will be included.


In light of this important development, we are no longer
recommending limb amputation as a means to prevent the
onset of Harran virus symptoms.  Please coordinate your
office with the Mayor and other local officials to make this
information known to the public as soon as possible.

Dear Erol,


I know how busy you must be with this terrible crisis going
on, but I have no one else to turn to. Hasad was killed
yesterday by a sick person, and this morning my daughter
Saliha and her son Eren showed up at my door, after her
husband was shot dead by a neighbor who thought he was
infected. There is little I can do for them. But perhaps you
could.


You know me, brother. I have never tried to take advantage
of your station to profit myself.

But this one time I must. Please take Saliha and Eren away
from here. They say there is no way out of the city, but if
there's an exception, it will be for you.


I am comfortable remaining in Harran, but I can't stand the
thought of my lovely daughter and grandson being attacked
by those terrible things out there. They are your blood, and
are good people, and worthy of your mercy. Please take
them into your care. I know you will, and so you have my
deepest gratitude.


Your Loving Sister,


Filiz

Reflections on fire:  How do you become a fire-eater?  Who
was the first guy to stick a burning hot flame down his
throat, and what made him think that was a good idea?
And who was the first nut-bag to walk on red hot coals,
and what made them think that would work out okay? They
say it's the sweat on your feet that keeps them from
bursting into flames.  Does that mean if your *ss is sweaty
you can sit on them?  I think the gas company should
investigate these things.  But they won't. Idiots. If only I

Reflections on fire: My experiments with fire weapons are
conclusive.  Fire is a very effective weapon against
anything that doesn't like fire, which is pretty much
everything, except fire.  Thus, the phrase "fight fire with fire"
is completely stupid.  Fighting fire with fire produces
considerably more fire, but the fire (the original "enemy" fire
that you were attacking with your fire) would probably
consider being a bigger fire an improvement and generally
beneficial. 


All the same, I should probably run some more
experiments.

Reflections on fire: I'm no hero. I'm just a regular guy who
sees things real clearly. We need a lot more fire to be safe
at the Tower.  Brecken thinks fire is dangerous.  Maybe to
him.  Maybe to people who don't know what they're doing.
But I've been starting fires since I was little kid.
Yes, I made some mistakes back then, and yes, I burned
down my neighbors' garage.  Big deal.  Anyway, I've
learned from my mistakes.  Fire will make us safe.  People
will soon flock to me in droves, seeking the protection of
my fire-walled command base.  They'll say I'm a hero, but
I'll say, "I'm no hero. I'm just a regular guy who sees things
real clearly."

Entry 1  I am keeping a jernol becus the man in the movy
about the smart mous had to keep a jernol. His name is
Alergynon, and the longer you keep the jernol, the smarter
you get. Right now my smart level is 8, so I'm smarter then
just about most people.  But this jernol will make me even
more smart. Gess it could be good to be even smarter!


Entry 2  Today my new smart level is 9, so I'm reely much
smarter than just about everybody who ever lived. When I
went to the farmacy to get my mom's drugs the drug man
said I could not have any more because my mom is a
pumpkinhead now.  So I started yell-singing in my super
voice. Then he said, ok-ok, and gave me the drugs.  He
was not neerly smart enuff to go agenst Gazi!


Entry 3  Today my new smart level is 10, so I probubly can't
go much hi-er.  I am so smart now I can barely talk to
people because they are so dum.  Maybe becuming
supersmart was a mistake.  A lot of the peeple I see on
the street are so much dumer than me that they seem to
not be saying words at all. Just noises.  If they don't see
me they just stand around doing nothing. When they do
see me they act stupid and get mad at me for being so
much smarter then them.  I used to think peeple were busy
and really smart.  Becuming 10-level smart has opened my
eyes about peeple and how dum and lazy they reely are.


From now on I'm going to keep away from them.  I just
make peeple angry with my supersmart mind. They wish
they were Gazi.  But they can't be Gazi.  Just me.

You know the magazine supports you--always. And no
one's saying you don't know what you're doing. You've
been to too many places where you were the only one who
did know what he was doing. But this one is different. 


Harran isn't just another basket case, with a madman
running the show. From what we're hearing (and it's not
much), the Harran virus is now completely out of control.
The effects of this disease are so uniquely horrifying that
walling in the city and putting a man like Suleiman in
charge actually makes a degree of sense.


Anyway, we can't get you in through any of our channels. I
won't say that we tried to, but we did look into what would
happen if we attempted it: They were on us in seconds.
People are watching us, and they're probably watching you,
so be careful how you send information. And to whom.


Last thing. If you do somehow manage to get into Harran,
you're going to have one hell of a time finding a way out. That
place is sealed tight.


Good luck, old friend.

You've got guts, but it's luck you're going to need most.

Alexei My Husband,


We have both seen enough of our friends destroyed by this
sickness to know that my fate will be no different. In a very
short time I will turn on you and Kristov and perhaps harm
you both.

I can't allow that to happen.


I am sorry that you will have to find me this way. Please
don't be mad at me. I love you and Kristov above all things,
but I must do what I must do to protect you both.


Now promise me you will do what you must do to protect
Kristov. He is too young to understand the consequences
of recklessness, and the world has become too unforgiving
of mistakes. Find safety wherever it is, and stay there.
Make peace with it. Ignore whatever flaws you will quickly
come to see, and make the best of the situation. It's the
only way you can survive, and that is what I want for you
most.


I love you. Farewell --Maja

Hanson Journal: Day 6.


Finally, everything is in place. It's a beautiful day, and we're
all lounging on the rooftop. A few biters are roaming
around, but for once I know they truly can't reach us. All
the doors are secured, and I have the only key. There won't
be any "oops, my bad" around here. I've never locked
myself out of a room, never lost a key or forgotten a lock
combination. I'm not perfect, but I don't screw up on
matters of security, because I use procedures and
checklists, and I stick to them no matter what.


The people who've joined me here have put a lot of trust in
me. Some were nervous about not having copies of the
building keys. But I told them anyone who can unlock these
doors can get you killed, and since they can also get me
killed, I'm the only one who gets keys. You either trust me,
or go back to The Tower. Nobody left.


I'm pretty damn pleased with what I've accomplished here,
but my finest achievement is the electrified fencing I've
encased the building in. Even the most determined volatile
would be pan-roasted in a matter of seconds trying to
scale it. The fencing is powered by a customized generator
that runs off the building's gas lines, so can't run out of
fuel. For safety reasons, I've allowed the generator to run
down its gasoline supply. Now I'll just head down and
switch it over to natural gas. And then it will run forever.


I predict tonight will be the best night's sleep I've had in
months. By god, I've earned it.

What a bunch of fools we were! Hanson, and all his talk
about security, and iron-clad rules, and his rigorous
procedures and checklists. Of course, his system was so
flawless, it had to fail.


Back at the Tower it seemed to make sense. Hanson was
always carrying on that too many people had keys, and
that the entries to the building were never locked anyway,
so that people could get in. "What kind of security is that?",
he'd say. "If people can get in, the biters can get in.
Brecken's going to get you all killed."

So we joined Hanson, and trusted him with everything. It
was okay for the first week.
We helped him encase the building with electrified fencing.
Great idea, Hanson! And then he set up his customized
generator, which he somehow got to run off the natural gas
lines, so it would never shut off. We told him he was a
genius. 


Well, you can't say it didn't work. It's been 14 days and it's
still running smoothly. 14 days since we had any food or
water. 14 days since we watched that knuckle-head fall off
the scaffold and hit the ground like a bag of wet cement.


He screamed when he hit the ground (I think he broke his
back), and that brought the biters in.

The others were horrified and felt sorry for him. Not me.
The instant I saw that jerk plunging to the ground, I knew
he'd killed us all. 


Hanson said he kept cyanide around because he always
thought someone else's negligence would let the infected
get in. That was his worst fear. Anyway, there should be
enough for all of us. Except for Seref, we've burned all of
our passports and driver's licenses, and anything with our
names on it. We don't want any record of who we were
and how stupidly we died. 


But know this:


The man who got us all killed was named Hanson. Roy
Hanson.

And he was a royal idiot!

This is my old school!  I still can't believe it. We arrived this
morning, and the Lieutenant said, "Secure those buildings
and set up a perimeter."  And here we are.  Gosh, that's
funny.
Never thought I'd set foot in this place again. 


There were lots of TV cameras on us when we were
entering the quarantine. Felt like a movie star or
something...


The last time I was in this school they said I was too lazy
to accomplish anything. Now I'm in my fatigues, with an
AK-47 and some hand grenades, and they think I'm a hero.
I guess that's mostly because of what the Colonel said.
When the news cameras were watching, the Colonel
announed that our orders were to assist the infected and
evac them to special medical facilities where they can be
treated. He said the doctors were anticipating a full
recovery for most of them.  People were cheering and
clapping about that. 


But as soon as the cameras were gone, we entered the
quarantine and he gave us the real orders: Shoot any
infected on sight.  That was a big relief.  I don't really want
to touch them. Shooting them is much easier. 

It sure is funny being back at my old school, shooting all
these people that I used to know.

Yo-yo Frankie-G,


Well, here we are in Harran!  Am I tripping?!


I thought it would be like all sand and Laurence of
Arabia-ish, but they've got roads and everything.  Well, not
everything.  Actually, I was thinking about opening a
Porky's Pork-Emporium here. You could make a fortune.
And when I say "you", I mean me, because that is a
Trademark Nick Pesto idea. We're friends and all, but this
is business.


So where are these games happening?  It's hard to
understand the foreigners who live here.

A lot of them don't even speak American. It's a real
problem, because last night this girl who looked road kill
was trying to come on to me (Americans, right?  We're like
gold down here!)

She was babbling in that groany gibberish language they've
got. She wasn't really my cup of tea, but I thought, when in
Rome, boink some Romans.  But then she went gnarly and
chomped me.  Now I feel weird.  Bet she gave me
sniffolous.  I think I should see a doctor.


But hey, we're in Harran!  This is so cool!  Good times for
Nick Pesto and Frankie G. Partae!


Your pal,

Nick

PS. I bet you're gonna freak when you see a real paper

GRE, Building #6 Pathogen Sciences Lab


Subject: Harran Outbreak, Patient Zero. 


I think we have a solid new candidate for Patient Zero.


The deceased, Mr. Baris Buruk was 37 years old.  He was
a white collar professional, who worked for a local public
relations firm, called Best Face Forward.  Their offices are
in Old Town.  His medical records are well-documented.
His health was good.  His co-workers (the ones who are
still alive and could be interviewed) described him as
intelligent and even-tempered. 


The sudden violence he displayed at his work place--he
killed two people and attacked six others--was not
triggereed by any particular event.  Witnesses said he was
feeling unwell, and had closed the door of his office to rest.
30 minutes later, a disturbing clamor could be heard inside
Mr. Buruk's office. A concerned woman who opened his
door was immediately attacked and beaten to death by Mr.
Buruk.


After several difficult minutes, he was subdued by workers,
who held him down until the police arrived.  At no time did
Mr. Buruk cease to struggle, though he was reported to
have uttered a few words that suggested fleeting moments
of awareness. When the police arrived, Mr. Buruk could not
be taken into custody peacefully. The responding officers
used batons to further subdue him, but this resulted in
lethal injuries, and Mr. Buruk was killed on the scene.


This event offured a full three days before the attacks at
the Seva Ashram, which we had considered to be the first
recorded incident of infection-induced violece. I suspect
the Buruk case was overlooked because, despite the
severe wounds Mr. Buruk inflicted on his victims, none of
them developed Harran virus symptoms.  Clearly, he had
not reached the transmission-viable stage of this very
unusual virus. 


Thus, we have a Patient Zero, who failed to produce any
other infected victims. From this we should deduce that the
pathogen must have achieved multiple points of entry into
the public simultaneously.  An air of water contaminant
seems unlikely, given the low numbers of early infected,
so, I'm thinking food supply.  With your permission, I'd like
to pursue this.


Bob.

It shouldn't be too much to ask the superintendent of the

wall. Please don't tell me that you can't do anything about
it. The stench is putrefying. How can you even stand it?


I'm very certain that Cemal Sabris in #206 moved out
because of it. I don't understand why she left in the middle
of the night without saying goodbye, but I'm positive it was
that terrible smell that sent her packing. 


I can assure you, if you don't do something about it soon,

Mr. Remzi, your concerns regarding OTC sales of
Phenol-Nitrate have been reviewed by both the Senior
Corporate and Legal Departments, and we are satisfied that
no action is necessary at this time. 


Phenyl-Nitrate is an important sterilization agent, used in
hospitals and in clinical research labs.  We believe the
public's interest in this product can be traced to ambitious
housewives, trying to achieve the same level of cleanliness
in their homes as one would find in a surgical operating
theater. Who wouldn't want that?


As to the numerous reports of Phenyl-Nitrate being used to
produce the illegal substance known as "Slam", we are
completely unaware of any such reports. 


In conclusion, Phenyl-Nitrate is useful and highly profitable
product in our inventory.


We consider this matter closed.  Please do not contact us
again on this topic.

SUBJECT: Tonight's newscast


Your lead newsman will read this exactly as it appears:


The army has rolled into the city, and that's good news for
the thousands of weary citizens who've been wondering,
"what happens next?" Military units moved quickly to
establish their presence, and to demonstrate that order is
being restored, and that the crisis will soon be over.

The forces were leasd by Army Colonel Berkant Uzer, but
are operating under the authority of Kardir Suleiman, who is
serving as temporary Governor, until the situation can be
normalized.


Civilians are advised to stay clear of military operations,
which will include aiding and airlifting thousands of infected
citizens to special medical facilities, that have been
specifically built for treating victims of the Harran virus.
Doctors are promising to employ a battery of different
treatments to reverse the devastating effects of the virus,
and they anticipate complete recovery for most patients.


During this emergency martial law will be in effect at all
times. Civilians are warned that anyone caught looting or
engaging in criminal activity will be dealt with severely. To
ensure public safety, a sundown curfew is also in effect,
and will be strictly enforced. 


Military spokesmen say that additional rules and
regulations will be posted in public areas. It is the
responsibility of all civilians to stay informed, and to obey
any instructions issued by military personnel.

If you're reading this, I might be dead. I hope I'm not, of
course, but I have to tell you, things don't look too rosy in
good ol' Harran these days. Especially for a scrawny,
bookish type like Yours Truly. I got all excited when the
letter came, telling me I'd received a fellowship to the
university here. Now? Not so excited. All I wanted to do
was get my degree and finish my latest novel. And writing
is not just a hobby, MOM. It's what I'm going to do for the
rest of my life! I don't think self-publishing nineteen
science-fiction novels in two years is something you do if
you're not serious! ...Anyway, I'm sort of figuring out how to
survive in here, and as I do, I'll record it all in these pages.
So if you're finding this stuff, and I'm not around, well...I
hope you have better luck than I did.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I figured out a pretty good use for firecrackers. I had a
barrel rigged to blow, but none of those damn rotters
would come near it. So I got up on the roof, tossed a
bundle of firecrackers next to the car, waited for them to
shamble over, and then BOOM! Set it off and got every one
of them! I think I might try to throw some right down below
me, and then attempt one of those "Ground Pound" moves
I've seen the guys from the Tower use. Assuming I ever
figure out how they do that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////
/ Entry #2 [BAT-2] /
////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------------------
One more use for firecrackers! And I sort of figured it out
by accident. (Mom might have been on to something when
she said I shouldn't play with fireworks...or matches...)
Anyway! You can use firecrackers to distract Volatiles at
night. On a related note, you can also use flares to create
temporary safe spots, and if you've got a buddy you can
trade off with, it'll work even better. I'm guessing. I gotta
say, night in this city is no time to be stupid. But I'm not
stupid, am I? I don't THINK so! Despite the sales figures on
all my self-published science-fiction novels, Marvin Zucker
is a WINNER!
---------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////
/ Entry #3 [BAT-3] /
////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------------------
One thing I've noticed for sure: you need to dodge when
you're fighting the rotters. Like, a lot. Especially if you come
up against one of the big guys. Remember to stay on the
move, don't rely on brute force, and if you're lucky you'll
survive. If you just stand there swinging your weapon,
however, you'll get overrun. (Dodging makes really good
use of my not-overly-developed physique. I bet those guys
on the football team couldn't evade a bunch of rotters!
Nope, they'd be lunch. And I might be laughing. Just a little.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////
/ Entry #4 [BAT-4] /
////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you come across any hostile humans, I've found it's
really kind of awesome to use the rotters against them. I
mean, why should I risk losing a weapon or, y'know, getting
gnawed on, when I can just make some noise (blow up a
barrel or something) and draw every viral in the vicinity
right to where the *ssh*les are?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////
/ Entry #5 [BAT-5] /
////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a really good idea to look for things in the environment
to use against the rotters. There's the obvious things, like
electric fences or exploding cars, but if you think
creatively--and I do--you'll notice other, shall we say,
"opportunities." Pools of water with cables in them, for
example. If you switch on the closest lamppost, that'll fry
any rotters that splash through it. Ooh! Or spikes! If you find
some spikes, try to throw or kick the rotters at them. Talk
about satisfying!

it off the freaking ground--and then the tank explodes!

It doesn't matter. What matters is that it'll clear whole
areas fast if you do it right.

Okay, so you've heard me talk about Volatiles, and if you're
unlucky enough or dumb enough, you've seen one or two
yourself. Well, this is important: You can hide from
Volatiles in the water! It always works! I'm serious, dive
below the surface and wait a few seconds, and they just
wander off! Guess their senses aren't strong enough to find
you underwater? Or maybe they just have REALLY short
attention spans. I don't care, I just know it works. I also
know I need to do more cardio, because my lung capacity
is just terrible.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////
/ Entry #8 [BAT-8] /
////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------------------
So here's a pleasant little surprise! I got some batteries
and rigged myself up an electrified weapon. With me so
far? Okay, well, so, I hit a rotter with it, except--this is the
good part--it was RAINING. And all of a sudden arcs of
electricity just start flying out of the guy, seriously, like
miniature bolts of lightning, and guess what? THEY STRUCK
HIS FRIENDS, TOO! How sweet is that?? I might have peed
a little. It was hard to tell, since I was already soaking wet.
Hmmm...wonder how else I could boost my DIY weapons...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW RULE: no loud noises! Loud noises bring Virals like
flies to freaking honey! I know I mentioned that before,
about blowing up barrels and stuff like that, but "loud
noises" don't even have to be all that loud to pull those
sons of b*tch*s in. Only thing I did was fall through a
wooden roof today, and you would've thought I'd stood up

Note to self: always look for metal parts. When your

best places to get them are tool boxes. And yeah, I know,
technically it's stealing. Those tool boxes belong to the
honest, hard-working mechanics of Harran. Well, for one
thing, those guys aren't around anymore, are they? And for
another, the other place to look is in municipal trash bins.
And my GOD those things stink. I'm sticking with the tool
boxes.

wasn't. It wasn't. It was a rotter, and those cries turned into
this God-awful shrieking...and I got the hell out of there. I
can still see that thing. Still hear that shriek. Makes me
want to dig my eardrums out with an ice pick.

I was prowling around tonight, being careful--I'm always

these things before, once or twice, and always at night.
They're covered with green blobs that might be blisters,
and they seem to gather in a few specific locations in the
city. Their feeding grounds? Their hatchery? I don't know,
but I know I don't want to find out. I think the Tower guys
call them "Bolters." I penciled in their favorite haunts on

I've tried my level best to avoid Rais's thugs, but I almost

easy to spot, wearing all that yellow, and they are
CONVINCED that they own the whole city. (...They might be
right.) They tend to cluster around supply drops, so if you
want one, you'll have to go through some of those jerks.
I've watched them fight. Someone trained them well. They
don't charge at you like madmen. No, they're methodical,
and they keep their guard up. You'd have to look for a good
window to attack. If you stay focused, though, it's...definitely
likely that you might survive.

chunk out of my shoulder. So, okay, real quick here, before
I put an end to this foolishness once and for all... here's the
plot to my final novel. Maybe whoever finds this will have
the kindness and the way with words to put it all down on
paper for me. Okay, so, a guy gets inducted into an
interstellar military force, and deployed to a distant planet,
and the C.O. talks to his men and says "Boys, whatever
you do, do NOT have s*x with the local women!" But these
chicks have purple skin and huge bazongas, and Our Hero
can't help himself, and then he ends up infected with this
alien STD. And then, this is the really good bit, he CAN'T GO
BACK TO EARTH. The military won't let him, 'cause he's
contagious! So he gets sent to a quarantine planet! And
he's got to find out what the origin of the disease is, or it'll
slowly kill him! Hmmm...now that I think about it, that plot
might have been influenced by my current predicament.
Just a bit. Not that I had s*x with a rotter or anything. I'm
just sayin'.
Marvin Zucker, signing off.

Josef, this is your father! I hope and pray you are well and
hearing this. I made it to my uncle's old flat and barricaded
myself in. Come here and knock on the gate -- as many
knocks as Yonka's age, so I know it's you, I've got supplies
and everything! Please hurry!

Isa... Isa, I failed. I failed you again. I couldn't help our kids.
There were too many of them, and I froze, and then it was
too late. Forgive me, Isa. I can't go on like this anymore.
We'll meet again soon.

Farid? Farid, we're organizing a militia!
All men between 14 and 60 are to show up on the square
in front of Tarrik's shop. We'll meet every day at 9 a.m.! We
need to defend ourselves. You have to be there!

Hey--Dad? It's me. I want to tell you something. Something
I've always been afraid to. But it doesn't matter now. Dad,
you are the worst man I have ever known. You treated me
and mom like f*ck*ng punching bags. Did that make you
feel big? Powerful? Well, you're a worthless piece of sh*t. I
hope you die alone, *ssh*le.

[TRANSLATION:] Listen! This is important! Do not go through
the gas station! There's a big group of bandits there.
They're heavily armed, and if they don't shoot you on sight,
they demand either food or women in exchange for gas.
Stay away!

Mama, they don't want to let us out! I'm scared. The radio
says it'll be fine, but I don't believe them. Mama, please, get
me out of here! The little one keeps crying. I'm so stressed,
my milk has gone dry, and I have to feed him the artificial
stuff, but I'm running out of that, too. Mama, get me out of
here!

[TRANSLATION:] My beloved daughter. I know you hate me. I
know you think I'm the world's worst mother. Now... Now
that I'm dying, I want you to know the truth. I did not
consent to you donating bone marrow for Hakkan
because...because you are not his daughter. It would not
have matched. Uncle Adrian is your father. Seek him out,
he will explain everything.

This is my last will and testament. I, Barruk Osaman,
hereby declare that upon my death, I transfer all of my
material assets to my wife, Janissa. My children are entitled
to nothing! I declare that I made this will voluntarily and that
I am of sound mind.

My beloved, I am recording this while you're asleep. I'm
setting out to find us a better hideout and some food. I
might not come back. If that is the case, escape north, to
the old districts. Seek refuge there. Don't wait for me more
than 48 hours. I'll do what I can to return to you. I love you.

[TRANSLATION:] They say you can always fix your mistakes.
I really wanted to make up for what I did, but...damn, why
did I wait so long? Now there's no time left... Tom, I love
you. I was an idiot. Please say you'll forgive me?

What words from a poet, in a city imprisoned
where the human mind is dead, by hunger enslaved,
where one man is like a wolf to another
and all the sides
closed, with a wall surrounded
a nightmare...

Hello, Fatma--It's Orhan. I've gone downtown, and I don't
know when I'll be back. I have a score to settle. I've waited
for an opportunity for almost three years. What's happening
is very bad but perhaps it is also a gift from fate. Either I
will do it now or never. Someone has to pay for their sins.

Lieutenant? We've detained a man named Ali Atalay. He's
been keeping an infected family member, one Yen Atalay,
in his house, chained up. Ali was feeding the infected with
raw meat of unnown origin. He did not want to divulge any
information, and was generally very uncooperative. We put
down the infected, and executed Ali on the spot, per your
directives.

[spoken during s*x*al intercourse] Farid? Can you...can you
hear me? This is...your wife. I...I HATE you. I've hated
you...for years. I'm with...Adnan...and he and I both wanted
you to...hear us. [The panting gets louder, becomes
screams of pleasure, and the call hangs up]

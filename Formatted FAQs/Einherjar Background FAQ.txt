==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Einherjar Background FAQ for Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria. I created the guide to help readers understand how Einherjars work in the Valkyrie Profile universe. Einherjars first appeared on Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (simply Valkyrie Profile on the PS1 version) and are portrayed strongly, each Einherjar had short scenes showing how they died (which were often heart-warming scenes). In Silmeria, they do not have these scenes but had a more interesting story because they are more involved in the game\'s storyline than Lenneth.

==Actual History==

===The Beginning Years===

In the year 80 C.C, the military nation of Fraelgard was erected on an island to the south of the main continent. 

Thirty two years later in 112 C.C, Mithra was born and became the commander of the Fraelgard army later in his life. He was a loyal and powerful leader that led the construction of hidden fortresses to fend off invaders from Fraelgard. A mistake made by one of his subordinates, however, caused Mithra to be captured by a rival nation where he was tortured to spill secrets about his nation and king. The king who ordered Mithra\'s death on the battlefield was in shock when Mithra\'s body was delivered to Fraelgard a year later in 146 C.C. with no eyes, ears, or tongue.

Centuries later in 308 C.C, Atrasia was born in the village of Tehm, which laid to the north of the main continent of Midgard. The tribe of Tehm could live in peace as long as they sacrificed a Protector to receive blessings from the gods, as per their customs.

In 324 C.C, Lwyn was born in Kalstad and joined the treasure hunting guild called Truth, alongside her father. Together, the two of them have slain many monsters and discovered many artifacts as well.

The custom of Tehm called for a pure Protector to be sacrificed, but Atrasia, the Protector at the time, gave birth to a child. Her child died and a saddened Atrasia ventured to Nifelhiem to retrieve her child\'s soul. She was successful but she broke the laws that Tehm and the gods had agreed upon. Odin, angered by this action, allowed a group of undead to attack and destroy the village. Atrasia was able to escape to a nearby town with her child, but died from exhaustion and severe wounds in 333 C.C.

Thirteen years later, in 346 C.C, Lwyn died after she told Truth about finding a royal tomb in the Sahma Desert.

Four years passed and Falx was born on the outskirts of Gerabellum in 350 C.C. When he was young, the undead killed his parents and Falx vowed to have revenge against them. He practiced his swordplay as well as his magic skills to be able to fight against the undead. This, combined with his intelligence, made Falx one of the most dangerous undead hunters in history. In 375 C.C., Falx found Brahms\' Castle and met with the Lord of the Undead. He challenged Brahms to a fight to the death, but lost.

In 390 C.C., Aegis was born in Solde and became a revered naval commander throughout the lands due to his ability to read the ocean. Sometime before he became a naval commander, Aegis sacrificed his ability to swim in exchange for the ability to read the water to some water nymphs. In a battle against some pirates that were pillaging Solde, Aegis was knocked into the water and drowned in 418 C.C.

Five years later, in 423 C.C., Psoron was born in Paltierre and became a scholar that invented the magic spells Fire Storm and Guard Reinforce to combat the undead. Because of this feat, Psoron became the court sorcerer for the king of Paltierre.

In 445 C.C., Jessica was born in Nethov to an aristocratic family. 

Five years later in 450 C.C, Psoron died due to unknown reasons.

Jessica led a great life with her father\'s wealth. Once she became of age, she was engaged to be married, but her father lost all the family\'s money and his life. Her fiance called off the wedding and Jessica was left all alone. At this time, it is presumed that Jessica was with her fiance\'s child, whom would grow to be Gerald. She gave birth to Gerald in 464 C.C. With sword in hand, Jessica became an adventurer to take care of herself and Gerald. In 468 C.C., Odin placed the sealed location of an ancient dragon in some ruins and dispersed a rumor regarding an enormous gemstone in said ruins. Jessica heard of the rumor and went after it. Unfortunately, when she came into contact with the gemstone, the dragon emerged from the seal and killed Jessica.

Once released from its resting place, the evil dragon tortured the town of Nethov for years and years. Gerald, a concerned town citizen and Jessica\'s son, gathered a group of 99 warriors and headed for the ruins, which had now become the dragon\'s den. In the brutal fight, Gerald was able to strike the dragon in its chest, but unbeknownst to him, the dragon had poisonous blood. The blood spewed from its body and killed Gerald, the warriors, and decayed all the living things in the Nethov region. Thus, the town of Nethov was turned into a swamp in the year 489 C.C.

===The Age of Turmoil===

Fifty years later, many of the more famous Einherjar we know were born, starting with...

Khanon was born in 539 C.C. in Gorhla.

Guilm was born in 546 C.C. in Dipan.

Roland was born in 548 C.C. in Arkdain.

Ehlen was born in 549 C.C. in Gerabellum.

Richelle was born in 550 C.C. in Arkdain.

Adonis was born in 553 C.C., as well as Aaron, who was born in Arkdain.

Farant was born in 554 C.C. in Lassen.

Ehrde was born in 555 C.C. in an unknown region.

Celes was born in 556 C.C in the Royal Castle of Dipan as a princess and Fraudir was born in Arkdain.

Xehnon was born in 562 C.C. in Rosetta and Crescent is born in Gerabellum. Crescent is born into an aristocratic family, but her mother dies and her father remarries.

Alm was born in 563 C.C. in the Pincipality of Paltierre as a prince.

Phyress was born in 564 C.C. in the Royal Castle of Dipan as a princess.

Sylphide was born in 567 C.C. in Dipan and became Phyress\' attendant at a young age.

In 572 C.C., when Crescent was 10 years old, a nearby nation sought to overtake Gerabellum. To appease this nation, Crescent\'s stepmother used Crescent and her family as a bargaining chip. Along the way to the nation, Crescent\'s family was killed by bandits, but Gerald stepped in and saved Crescent. For saving her life and with no one else to turn to, Crescent followed Ehlen and learns how to fight from him. Due to the overtaking of Gerabellum, the War of Camille Hill begins to take root.

Gerabellum\'s own army kept the invading country from taking over, with Ehlen being the most prominent member of the Gerabellan army, earning him the title Demigod Ehlen. Adonis also participated in the war as a stray mercenary and became known as Black Blade Adonis.

The first nation to join with Gerabellum is Paltierre, led by Dragon Scale Sigmund, the king of Paltierre.

The second nation to join is Dipan. In 573 C.C., Celes and Guilm, serving as Celes\' second in command, join the war with the army of Dipan. Celes becomes known as Warrior Princess Celes and Guilm is known as Baron Blade Guilm. Seluvia is born in the town of Rand as well during this year.

A year later in 574 C.C., Arkdain joins up and the king of Arkdain sends Roland and the army of Arkdain, the Knights of the Bloodsword, to participate in the war. Richelle is also sent by Count Leon, the younger brother of the king of Arkdain, to join the war along with his royal guard, the White Lily . Both Roland of the Thundercry and Richelle of the Simmering Sanmite aided in the protection of an important defensive line in the war with their expert swordsmanship, gaining them a spot as two of the Seventeen Commanders.

Sometime during the war, Lassen also joins the war. It is presumed that the lord of Lassen joins the war as a commander and becomes close to Celes.

In 575 C.C., the War of Camille Hill begins. The Kingdom of Dipan, the Principality of Paltierre, the Arkdain Kingdom, and Lassen fight together.

In 576, Celes retreats from the war and goes home, as well as the lord of Lassen. Celes marries the lord and retires from fighting.

One year later in 577 C.C., the king of Arkdain and Count Leon call back Roland and Richelle from the frontlines. On their way back, they passed through the Gorhla region, where they were killed. Khanon, the lord of Gorhla at the time, denied partaking in this incident. Childhood friends Aaron and Fraudir were called in by both brothers to take over Roland\'s and Richelle\'s position, respectively.

Khanon, the ruler of Gorhla started to visit the king of Arkdain more often due to the casualties from the war. Eventually, he had enough power to decide on stately affairs.

In 578 C.C., Xehnon, a scholar of Rosetta came into contact with an ancient tome called the Manuscript of Manifestation. This tome took control over Xehnon, but imparted him with great intelligence. Eventually, he became the court sorcerer to the king of Rosetta and gained control over him akin to Khanon.

The Manuscript of Manifestation, although powerful, was left behind by Odin to wreak havoc upon the land of Midgard.

After 4 long years of fighting, the War of Camille comes to an end in 579 C.C., and every nation went their separate ways. At this time, Crescent also returns home to her house in Gerabellum, only to learn that it was her stepmother that initiated the attack against her and her family. Her stepmother gave the bandits that murdered her family the route by which they were traveling to the rival nation. She kills her stepmother and she and Ehlen take leave of Gerabellum.

Peace, although gained, was lost in this same year as well in the Arkdain Kingdom. Khanon had finally gained the king\'s trust and influenced him to fight against his little brother, Count Leon. The Knights of the Bloosword and the White Lilies were once again thrust into a war, although not against a common enemy, but against each other. This civil war was known as the Arkdain Uprising. Using this war to his advantage, Khanon was able to create his own neutral clerical faction that opposed both the king and his brother. With an army, the Division of the Sacred Cross, Khanon now had a nation of his own in the making, soon to be complete...

In 580 C.C., Crescent and Ehlen both joined the army of the ever growing nation of Rosetta, the Knights of the Sun. Xehnon recruited them along their travels with his lofty ideals and both were made into generals of the army. Ehlen became the Horizon General and Crescent becomes the Meridian General. Adonis and Ehrde also become the Eclipse General and Twilight General, respectively.

Perhaps the most important year in the history of Midgard before Alicia\'s time would have to have been 581 C.C. A major event called the Year Long War took place at this time, and Phyress, the Princess of Dipan, becomes the most prominent member of this war.

In the beginning of the year, Princess Phyress of Dipan, Sylphide, and Guilm begin traveling throughout the world. Although it doesn\'t state the time in any sources, these three characters were involved in a battle called the Battle of Paltierre. Later, they were pulled into the Arkdain Uprising, although there are no sources that say which army they fought for.

For Khanon, things were about to end very soon. Once he got coronated as Pope of his clerical faction, he\'d be on equal grounds, politically, to a kingdom. In Audoula Lake Temple, as Khanon was being anointed as a Pope, Twilight General Ehrde shot a poisoned arrow through his heart and Khanon died without realizing his dreams.

Back in Arkdain, the forces of the king of Arkdain and Count Leon come into contact in central Arkdain. The Arkdain Uprising ends with Count Leon\'s forces seizing the capital. Still loyal to his king, Aaron, captain of the Knights of Bloodsword, challenged Fraudir, captain of the White Lily, to a duel. After a long match, an exhausted Fraudir sheathed her sword and allowed Aaron to kill her. The war had been won and she had no reason to kill her childhood friend, so Fraudir accepted death. To respect Fraudir\'s wishes, Aaron didn\'t receive treatment for his wounds and he died a few days later.

Xehnon, still under the Manuscript\'s control, ignites the flames of war by having the king of Rosetta send Adonis and Ehrde to capture Celes while the lord of Lassen is away.

In her stately home in Lassen, Queen Celes is confronted by Adonis and Ehrde. A duel commences between Adonis and Celes, with Celes being the victor by decapitating Adonis\' head. Tired from the fight, Queen Celes is kidnapped by Ehrde and he flees to Rosetta. This action, called the Lassen Invasion, began the dreaded Year Long War.

In the same fashion that he used to recruit Crescent and Ehlen, Xehnon explained his goal of the war to Celes. His goal was to unite the continent together to fight against the oppressive rule of the gods in Asgard. Believing in him, Celes joins the Knights of the Sun and takes over Adonis\' title and position as Eclipse General.

The generals are now scattered throughout the land. Ehlen and his brigade head to Paltierre, Ehrde remains in Lassen to defend it from being seized, Crescent stays in Rosetta to act as backup to any of the generals that need it, and Celes heads off towards her hometown of Dipan via sea, fighting its navy along the way.

Phyress, still traveling with Sylphide and Guilm, decides to take care of the brewing problem. She calls a meeting with Paltierre, the resistance forces in Lassen, and Arkdain, uniting them to fight against Rosetta. They develop a strategy that utilizes the resistance forces of Lassen as a decoy and the other nations as interceptors.

The leader of the resistance in Lassen, Farant, uses guerilla tactics with a band of 100 troops to defeat much of Ehrde\'s 5,000 soldiers. Ehrde calls for backup and Crescent replies, as well as Ehlen. When Crescent arrives, Farant leads her troops to Artolia Pass and the turning point of the war occurs here. Crescent challenges Farant to a duel and ends up killing him.

However, this battle was part of Phyress\' plan to overtake Lassen. With Crescent\'s troops in Artolia Pass, Paltierre and Arkdain invade the captured Lassen and defeat Ehrde and his remaining soldiers. Ehlen, who comes to Artolia Pass to save Crescent\'s troops is confronted and killed by the undead. Shortly after, Crescent disappears.

Rand, a small town near the Artolian Pass, was taken and destroyed by the opposing force, with Seluvia being the only survivor. Phyress finds Seluvia and adopts him.

Now, all that was left to do was to defeat Rosetta to put an end to the war. The 4 nations of Dipan, Paltierre, Arkdain, and Lassen, still united, head off to Rosetta to put an end to the madness. The nations surround Rosetta and a the Battle of Rosetta takes place.

In the midst of the battle, Sylphide is killed by enemy troops, pregnant with a child at the time. Guilm, saddened by this, sacrifices his life to bring Sylphide back to life.

The two sisters, Celes and Phyress, encounter each other again, although this time not as sisters, but as enemies. A dreaded duel ensues with Phyress losing an arm to Celes\' sword and Celes taking an incurable wound from Phyress\' arrow.

With Celes severely injured, Phyress takes off into the castle of Rosetta. In the depths of its halls, Phyress encounters Xehnon and notices the Manuscript of Manifestation Xehnon holds. She burns the tome, resulting in Xehnon\'s release from the dreaded curse. Thus, the Year Long War comes to an end. All nations return back home and Phyress marries King Cyphel of Paltierre.

===The Mists of Niflheim===

A year later in 582 C.C., Sylphide gives birth to Dyn in Dipan, and another year later in 583 C.C., Phyress gives birth to Chrystie. During this year, Celes also dies from the wound she sustained from her sister.

In 586 C.C., Xehnon, who was in the midst of restoring the ravaged nation, was killed by bandits.

Nine years pass and Seluvia leaves the Principality of Paltierre and becomes a bard. As a possible heir to the throne, Seluvia gets scared of a fight breaking out between the other heirs, so he leaves to avoid such a problem. Chrystie follows after him 5 years later, also leaving as a bard.

In 599 C.C., Hel, the Queen of the Underworld, seeks to torment the humans on Midgard and releases a slew of undead and demons out of her domain. For three years the world is covered in a darkness that becomes known as the Mists of Niflheim. Sylphide is killed by the undead while Dyn is away. When Dyn learns of her death, he seeks revenge for Sylphide and sets out to find and seal the portal to the underworld.

In 601 C.C., the undead dragon lord of the underworld terrorizes Paltierre. Prince Alm attempts to destroy it, but ends up getting killed.

On his journey, Dyn meets up with Seluvia and Chrystie. Together, the three of them travel Midgard, slaying the undead and looking for the portal to the underworld. A year later in 602 C.C., they locate the portal and successfully seal it. Unfortunately, Dyn gets stuck on the other side with Hel and her minions. She tortures Dyn until he dies, while Seluvia and Chrystie sing praises about him throughout Midgard. The two of them disappear from the annals of history after this incident...

Twenty years pass and Phyress dies to an illness. Five years after her death, Cyphel also passes away, and Paltierre falls without a prince or princess to succeed to the throne. During this year, 627 C.C., Sha-kon is born on an island to the southwest of the main continent.

===The Age of Restoration===

Three years later in 630 C.C., Kraad is born, followed by Circe four years later. In 639 C.C., Tyrith is born in Lassen.

As an only child, Sha-kon grew up lonely. Using her magnificent intelligence, Sha-kon started creating golems to keep her company. Still, the golems she created were but mindless beings, so all of her work resulted to nothing. Sha-kon started getting interested in affixing souls to golems in order to make them lifelike, but when she did go through with the research, she discovered something new: golems could use souls as a source of energy too. The golem she created with the soul disappointed her, but she did not have a chance to fix her mistakes, for the people in her town accused her of practicing witchcraft and she was executed in 650 C.C.

In 658 C.C., Kraad and Circe helped in the founding of Villnore. However, a rebellion led by Tyrith, a warrior claiming to be a descendant of Celes, caused major problems for them. Circe, who was a famed blacksmith, created powerful weapons and sturdy armors for Kraad, her husband, to fight against the rebellion. Tyrith, leading the army of Arkdain, fought against Villnore and Circe was killed in battle in 658 C.C. Masato was also born at this time. Using strategic tactics, Kraad led the Villnorian army against the rebellion led by Tyrith to Audoula Lake Temple and destroyed the main portion. Tyrith and most of her troops died in 659 C.C. Even after Tyrith\'s death, a portion of the rebellion remained and in 662 C.C., Kraad was shot by a poisoned arrow.

Years went by and Masato became a powerful sorcerer. However, during his time, a corrupt tyrant ruled over his homeland and Masato joined the rebellion to defeat the government. He was betrayed by his friend during the war and he fled from his homeland to the main continent. On the main continent, he was rescued by villagers from a nearby village, and repaid their kindness by fighting against the undeads that plagued them. During one of his fights, he accidentally struck himself with one of his own spells. Shortly after, Masato withered away in 681 C.C.

Twenty three years afterwards, Rasheeka was born in Kalstad. A year later, Arcana was born. Both of the girls became good friends and powerful warriors. Throughout their lifetimes, their hometown of Kalstad was victim of 4 attacks by the Crell Monferaigne army. However, Rasheeka, Arcana, and another hero from Kalstad managed to stop all 4 attacks. With Arcana\'s knowledge of weather patterns and Rasheeka\'s knowledge of the land and water, both girls were able to stay the Crell Monferaigne army. In the Fourth Invasion of Kalstad in 624 C.C., both of them were killed, but were revered by the Crell Monferaigne army for their efforts. Thus, a truce was created between the 2 nations. Woltar was also born in the Salerno region at this time.

In 730 C.C., Lylia was born into an aristocratic family. When she turned 16 years old, Lylia captured the eye of the king of Crell Monferaigne and was about to marry into the royal family. However, she was already in love with Woltar, so during the wedding ceremony, Woltar created chaos by appearing in the ceremony and snatching Lylia. The two fled to Woltar\'s hideout in the Salerno region and both were happy together. They had a daughter, Lydia, in 748 C.C., and lived together with her until 752 C.C. When Lydia was 4 years old, Lylia was spotted in the Salerno region by a Crellian and her location was given to the Crell Monferaigne royal family. Taking immediate action, the royal family dispatched soldiers to retrieve her. When the soldiers found her, they killed Woltar and dragged Lylia and Lydia back to Crell Monferaigne.

After witnessing that tragic event, Lylia turned mad. She was no longer of a sane mental position. A month later, atop the rooftop of the castle walls, Lylia jumped from the rooftop in front of the king. Two years later in 754 C.C., Zunde was born in a town called Quiryl, near the Loahm Hill.

Lydia, who was now fatherless, motherless, and not of the royal family\'s blood, was subjected to shame and ridicule from her peers and subjects alike. To prove herself worthy, Lydia trained hard with the bow and arrow, becoming one of the most renowned archers in the history of Midgard. But her jealous brother-in-law, Cain, hired bandits to kill her in 769 C.C. His jealously stemmed from the fact that the king of Crell Monferainge was planning to make her the next ruler, even though she was a bastard child, due to Cain\'s ineptitude as a prince. He was shortly killed afterwards for this action.

Sophalla was born three years later in 772 C.C. in Gerabellum, with her younger sister, Millidia, borne a year later in 773 C.C.

Three years later, Zunde and his friends were traveling through Camille Hill, when they received a request to dispatch some monsters in the area. The adventurers set forth and were never heard from again...

After Sophalla\'s and Millidia\'s parents died, Sophalla had to take care of her sister. She joined the Thieves\' Guild, a guild that specialized in stealing and assassinations, and was trained as an assassin. Sophalla used the money she earned to take care of both her sister and the under-privileged kids, though none knew how she was making money.

When Sophalla turned 16, she caught the lord of Gerabellum\'s eye and shortly after, they married. Sophalla went from rags to riches in the blink of an eye and she invited Millidia to the royal family. Unaccustomed to such a lifestyle, Millidia returned back to the slums. Due to her sudden increase in status, the Thieves\' Guild started sending blackmail to Sophalla. Unable to hide her past anymore, she came clean to her husband, and together, both fought against the Thieves\' Guild.

Angered by her actions, the Thieves\' Guild managed to kill the lord of Gerabellum, leaving a frustrated and angry Sophalla to destroy the Thieves\' Guild members, disguised as regular houses in the slums of Gerabellum. She even disowned Millidia as her sister in order to protect her.

In Millidia\'s eyes, however, this sudden action looked like Sophalla being consumed by power and wanting to erase her past by attacking the poor, harmless people of the slums. Using her naivete, the Thieves\' Guild devised a plan to swap Sophalla with Millidia to stop her from attacking the slums. Millidia agreed and the plan went into effect shortly after.

The Thieves\' Guild captured Sophalla, crushed her throat, and sold her to slavery. Millidia was then thrusted into Sophalla\'s position as ruler of  Gerabellum. In 796 C.C., Sophalla died, still in the clutches of slavery.

Six long years passed until Millidia finally figured out the truth. Surprised and ashamed, Millidia gathered the leaders of the guild together in their hideout to have a meeting. She then proceeded to set the hideout on fire, killing the leaders, some of its members, and herself. This event was disguised as a theater fire.

Phyress: What made you so cruel? You just left without warning!
Chrystie: Mother!? So it *is* you!

===Phyress & Dyn===
Phyress: Phyress: If you are his son, it must have happened when we traveled 
together on that journey, but when?

===Guilm & Phyress===
Guilm: My lady, my queen, my princess... what should I call you?
Phyress: It is all ancient history, now. Call me whatever you like.

===Phyress & Celes===
Phyress: Hey sister!
Celes: No words of reproach? You have not changed.
Phyress: At the time it was kind of a pain, but look at me... And thanks to you I get to be reborn young.

===Phyress & Khanon===
Khanon: Hmph. If it isn't Dipan\'s own tomboy...
Phyress: Well, everyone in my family was the same. Must be in our blood.

===Woltar & Sha-kon===
Woltar: You are the trickster who seals human souls inside the bodies of dolls... You do not seem the type.
Sha-kon: Those who have power are the same wherever you go. Perhaps you and I are no different.

===Arcana & Rasheeka===
Arcana: Hey, we are together again, just like the old days!
Rasheeka: Yes... like the old days!

===Lylia & Woltar===
Lylia: I prayed a thousand times that we might one day be reunited.
Woltar: I too, my love. We must thank the fickleness of fate.

===Lydia & Lylia===
Lydia: Father and I were victims of your selfishness. You just did as you pleased. I shall never, ever forgive you.
Lylia: Lydia...

===Woltar & Lydia===
Woltar: Is that Lydia? You have grown mighty. I am sorry I did not protect you from everything that you have suffered.
Lydia: Father...

===Millidia & Sophalla===
Millidia: My sister... I am sorry... (sob) I am so sorry!
Sophalla: Silly child...

==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Tech List FAQ for Phantasy Star II. This guide will list the available techs in the game. It will detail the different techs on how to acquire them, which characters learn these techs, what is the effect of each tech etc. For those unfamiliar with Phantasy Star, the word "'''Tech'''" is the Phantasy Star's other word for "'''magic'''" or "'''spell'''" in other RPG games so don't be confused.

==How to use Techs==

If you wish to view all the techs your character can use, open up the MENU, select STRNG, choose your character, then hit the C button. There will be two tables. The left table holds the techs you can use outside of battle while the right table holds the techs you can use during battle.

To use a tech outside of battle, open up the MENU, select TECH, choose your character, and select their tech. Certain techs will not appear outside of battle.

To use a tech in battle, select STGY, select ORDR, select the character whose tech you wish to use, then select the second icon (blue magic-looking thing), and pick which tech you want to use. If you have selected an attack tech, your tech will be cast until the end of the battle. If you have selected a healing or defensive tech, your tech will be cast until the effect is achieved. Certain techs will not appear in battle.

==Tech List==

Most techs can not be acquired from outside resources (with the exception of [[Musik - Special Tech|Musik]]). Techs can only be learned by gaining levels. All characters in Phantasy Star II are level 1 by default.

Tech names are not obvious, there is no fire tech, but there is an equivalent tech for that effect. There are no numbered ranks for each strength of tech. Instead, prefixes are used. No prefix is the weakest. Some of the following prefixes are:

*Gi-prefix - is medium in strength.
*Na-prefix - is the strongest techs when it comes to strength.
*Sa-prefix - these techs usually indicate a group effect, though the names of the techs often change slightly and can be misleading. 

It's always advisable to use a high-strength tech rather than a number of low-strength techs on groups of enemies. Same theory applies to group over standard techs.

Techs consume ''Tech Points'' or ''TP'' in gameplay. When you gain a level, you will gain more tech points, with the exception of Rudo. When you run out of points or have insufficient points to cast a tech, you won't be able to use it. There are no items within the game that restore TP. TP can only be restored by returning to a hospital in town and through healing. For this reason, you should try to have the Item equivalent of certain Techs in your inventory, just in case.

Not all attack techs are created equally. Some are general and will do damage to anything. Other techs are specific to Bio-monsters and Robots. Bio-monsters are what you fight until the Dam portion of the game whereas Robots begin appearing during the Dam section. Bio-monsters return when you fly to Dezo.

All characters do not learn the same techs. For example, [[Amy Sage|Amy]] leans heavily toward healing techs, [[Hugh Thompson|Hugh]] relies on bio-monster attacking techs, and [[Josh Kain|Kain]] relies on robot attacking techs. Know where you are in the game and where you will be going as you choose your team. While Techs are not necessary to the game, they will give you an advantage at times.

Techs primarily do a set amount of damage or healing. This number is connected to the ''MENTAL rating'' of that character in relation to the enemy. To find a character's mental rating, open up the MENU, select STRNG then choose your character. It is not known at this time whether certain techs are more effective on one enemy over another.

Techs will be listed by character. Techs will be presented in the following format:

*TECH - it's original name and if they have another name, this will be written in parenthesis.
*TP USED - number of TP consumed when used.
*USAGE - where the tech can be used. You can use it either during battle or outside of battles.
*TYPE - the type of tech.
*LEARNED AT - the level at which the character learns the tech.
*EFFECT - what the tech does.
*ITEM - the item equivalent of the tech. It's better to have the item equivalent if you do not have the tech yet.

===Musik - Special Tech===

A special tech called Musik cannot be learned by gaining levels, unlike those learned explained in the [[Tech List|Tech List]] section. To get this special tech, talk to ''Ustvestia'' in ''Oputa''. It costs 2,000 meseta for male characters and 5,000 meseta for female characters (there's a reason for this, but I leave it up to you to research why). As a precaution, do not teach it to Rudo because he cannot use useful techs. I haven't tried to teach him Musik. Know this when you use him, but remember his combat skills are the best in the game.

When using Musik, you used up 3 TP and what it does is it simply plays the piano that opens the ''Control Tower'' (which is the first dungeon in the second act of the game). This can only be used outside battle.

==Frequently Asked Questions==

*Q - Shouldn't it be THU instead of TSU?
**A - It depends. Some would argue that the THU implies thunder. In Phantasy Star IV, WAT is short for water, RES is short for restore, ANTI is short for antidote etc. I kept TSU as it is because it was the base spell, the origin from which the others came, and tried to follow that same idea through the rest of the '''renaming''' process.

*Q - What is your opinion on the best tech for each of the characters?
**A - It really depends on what you're using them for. Rolf is the best all-around tech user. Nei is not much because you have no choice for most of the game and the fact that she has a limited tech list. Amy is the best healer/defender. Hugh is useful for the first and last third of the game. His counterpart, Kain, is useful in the middle third. Anna, you don't really use for techs anyway, as her techs are often too specific and somewhat useless. Shir is nearly the same as Rolf and is probably made almost entirely redundant because you have Rolf all the time. Usually, I go through the end with Amy, Anna, Rolf, and Rudo. That's one weak tech user and a non-tech user included.

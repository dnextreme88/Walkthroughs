==General Background==

===What you need to know===

In Far Cry 5, you can have companions assist you as you explore and liberate Hope County. To have the ability to recruit companions, simply complete the story mission ''A Glimmer of Hope'' by following the objectives while inside Dutch's Bunker. After exiting the bunker, you will get a radio call from Dutch telling you that someone was kidnapped along the island. This will start the story mission ''Guns For Hire''. Simply complete the mission and you can recruit the first [[Fighters|fighter]] you liberated.

Throughout Hope County, you will encounter more of these fighters and [[Specialists|specialists]]. Fighters are recruited by simply liberating them from the cultists (eg. saving them from a cultist van or saving them while tied up in the middle of the road with cultists around) whereas the specialists can be recruited after completing the missions tied to them.

When your companions die, they will be unavailable to be recruited for 20 minutes in-game time and it decreases while in-game, including pausing the game or on the game menu. You can track their timer by selecting their avatars (Specialists have unique avatars) on the Roster menu.

You can check out the ''8-Bit Pizza Bar'' in ''Henbane River'' region to see your fighters (only those currently assigned on your roster) and specialists hanging out together. Of course, if you have not completed the respective mission of a specialist, you will not see them here. The only exception to these are the ''Fangs for Hire'' ([[Boomer|Boomer]], [[Cheeseburger|Cheeseburger]] or [[Peaches|Peaches]]). You can even listen to their hilarious conversations, though they will always have the same dialogue.

===Adding more companions===

By default, you can only have 1 companion following you at any time but can have a maximum of up to 2 companions. To have 2 companions following you at the same time, you must first recruit 3 different [[Fighters|fighters]] to unlock the ''Leadership'' sub-perk (costs 6 perk points). This is found under the Leader Perk of the Perks menu. Once purchased, you can now recruit up to 2 companions to fight by your side.

Take note that if you play in co-op with a friend, you can only use 1 companion at a time. You use 2 companions on single player.

===Controls===

Your companions can do a lot of things not just following you around. If you have not acquired the [[Adding more companions|Leadership perk]] yet, your companion will always be assigned to the 1st slot, which can be controlled using the ''G button'' (on default settings). With the perk, you gain access to the 2nd slot, which can be controlled using the ''H button'' (on default settings).

The following commands are things that your companions can do:

*Attack a target - press the G button or the H button. If you are crouched and are hidden, they will try to sneak at the target as you do whereas if you are not hidden, they will engage the target normally.
*Assist in attacking target while in a vehicle - this will be automatic. Your companions will open fire once an enemy is in sight while you are driving using any air, land, or sea vehicles.
*Drive a boat, car or helicopter for you - aim at the driver seat of a boat, car or helicopter and they will drive it for you. When you see a ''Commandeer'' command, simply press the G button or H button to command them to drive. If you have a waypoint set on your map, they will automatically drive to that location. You can also sit on a passenger seat of a vehicle and your companion will automatically sit on the driver's seat. If you have 2 companions, the companion assigned on the G slot will usually take the driver's seat.
*Follow you around - simply hold the G button or the H button. If you are in a boat, car or helicopter, they may not follow you automatically so you may have to get out and get in again.
*Move to a specific location - aim at a certain location and simply press the G button or H button. They will stay to that location until given another command. However, if you fast travel to another location, they will automatically follow you. If you point at a ladder, they will climb to it and remain in place once they got up.
*Revive you - this will be automatic. However, there are instances that they may not go and revive you due to incoming fire from cultists. Note that if you don't have any companion with you, you automatically die and have to restart from your last checkpoint.

If you need to stop them from a certain action, just let them do another command or let them follow you.

==Fighters==

Fighters are randomly-generated companions found across Hope County. Their appearances, classes, names, perks and weapons are random. Because of this, they do not have an any avatars associated with them, just the icons of the weapons they wield are used to identify them.

You may recruit up to 3 fighters on your roster. Once recruited, they are added to the ''Fighters'' section of the Roster menu. Unlike [[Specialists|specialists]], you can remove fighters or unassign them from your team by hovering to their avatars and pressing the ''F button''.

When recruiting fighters, their perks are not automatically unlocked. To unlock the first perk, you must achieve ''5 kills'' with that fighter. To unlock the second perk, you must achieve ''12 kills'' with that fighter. Perks are unlocked randomly and these are listed under the [[Fighter Perks|Fighter Perks]] section.

===Fighter Classes===

The following is a list of classes they can possess. Each class uses different tools for combat.

*Heavy - Carries a Machine Gun, such as the M60.
*Long Range - Carries Bows or Sniper Rifles, such as the Compound Bow or AR-CL.
*Melee - Carries melee weapons, such as a Baseball Bat, and Pipe.
*RPG - Carries an RPG-7 and a machine pistol.
*Soldier - Carries Assault Rifles, such as an AR-C.

===Fighter Names===

The following table is a list of first names and last names that the game randomly generates for your fighters. For example, a fighter may be named "Dan Smith" or "Dan Wolfe". During my playthrough of the game, I noticed that there are more first names than last names as shown on the table. Take note that this is an incomplete list, so if there is a name that's not listed and is found in the game, please [[Contact Information|email me]] and I will gladly credit you for your contribution.

You can purchase their respective Leader perks for 4 perk points that will significantly reduce their reviving time.

Your Fangs for Hire ([[Boomer|Boomer]], [[Cheeseburger|Cheeseburger]] or [[Peaches|Peaches]]) cannot ride with you on any air, land, or sea vehicles.

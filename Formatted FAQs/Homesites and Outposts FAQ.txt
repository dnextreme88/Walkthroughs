==Homesites==

The [[Ranger Station|Ranger Station]] is the only homesite you cannot issue commands into because this is ran by Thomas Ritter, a non-playable survivor. It only serves as introduction to managing your actual homesite as you finish your duties in Mount Tanner. The table below shows the homesite limits of [[Resource caches|resource caches]]. Take note that your storage capacity can be further increased by upgrading your [[Storage Area|Storage Area]] facility. The RV homesite type applies to the ''Breakdown'' DLC only.

==Facilities==

Certain facility bonuses turn red if conditions are not met. For example, the Good Night's Sleep bonus from the Pastor's Quarters in [[Church of the Ascension|Church of the Ascension]] homesite requires that everyone must have a bed. This is tied to the Beds bonus, where it provides 8 beds. If your population contains more than 8 people, everyone's stamina will not be increased by 10.

You can easily finish the construction of your facilities if you use the ''Construction Advice'' radio command. This is only available after completing all of ''The Grange''\'s missions. It has a cooldown of 90 in-game minutes. You can also remove facilities if you need to replace them. Removing a facility will always take ''1 minute'' to complete. Facilities that are in disarray cannot be used unless they are fixed. They will always cost 3 [[Influence|Influence]] and takes ''1 minute'' to complete.

===Materials needed===

You'll occasionally hit a snag when building your facilities. Facilities may require certain materials before progress continues. All materials reduce 4 hours to construction time of a specific facility. The following is a list of items Lily will radio you and will ask you to find around Trumbull Valley (take note that there's a lot of these items). Take note that [[Need.RVClean|Need.RVClean]], [[Need.RVEngine|Need.RVEngine]], [[Need.RVTires|Need.RVTires]] apply to the ''Breakdown'' DLC only.

==Homesite Elements==

===Beds===

Beds represent the number of space where everyone can get fully rested. Beds are basically tied to [[Population|Population]]. By having lesser beds than the population, everyone from your [[Homesites|homesite]] won't be fully rested, may not heal their illnesses, and may cause bad morale.

===Fame===

Fame represents how well-known and respected you are by other enclaves. Unlike [[Influence|Influence]], which fluctuates with use, Fame is much more static and only changes when the player completes specific actions. At the beginning of a (real-time) day, the amount of Influence is reset to half of Fame. You gain fame by leveling up survivors, completing missions and side missions, and completing advices from Lily (such as [[Garden|building a garden]], [[Medical Area|building a medical area]] etc.).

===Influence===

Influence acts as the game's currency. Influence is earned through missions, side missions, mission progresses, and the items you provide to your supply lockers. You use influence when taking items from your homesite supply locker, neighbor's supply locker, issuing certain actions from homesite facilities, and making radio commands. Make good use of your influence, because you can take weapons from your neighbors' supply lockers if you have enough influence.

===Labor===

Labor is the number of [[Population|people]] in your [[Homesites|homesite]] that is neither sick, injured, nor tired. Everytime a side mission is completed (rescuing a lost survivor from your community, helping survivors in supply runs etc.), their status changes and this will affect the Labor component of your homesite.

===Population===

Population refers to the number of people you have in your [[Homesites|homesite]]. It is important to have a balanced community, with respect to the number of [[Beds|beds]] you can provide to ensure that everyone has a place to stay. Having a lot of people in your [[Homesites|homesite]] is great, but will consume more resources because everyone shares resources and fights together whereas having less people also makes your community vulnerable and less capable of doing supply runs.

===Possessions===

Lists down what your [[Homesites|homesite]] is currently in possession of. They range from the following:

*Cars & Trucks - the list of available transportation currently present in the game. This will reduce depending on the number of cars that are still operable.
*Items - ammunitions, medicines, distraction items etc.
*Guns - guns that are in the supply locker.
*Weapons (Hand-to-hand) - melee weapons that are in the supply locker.

===Resource caches===

Resources can be scavenged in all structures as you play the game. Sometimes, when you haven't played the game in a while, the survivors in your community will occasionally gather resources for you as means to stay alive. The most common resource you'll most likely be finding is Food whereas the least resource you'll be finding is Ammunition. Take note that you can break down these resources and turn them into items if you need to.

|*RESOURCE TYPE |*DESCRIPTION |*ITEM EQUIVALENTS WHEN BROKEN DOWN |
|c Ammunition   | Each case represents the ammunition of a person on your [[Homesites|homesite]]. By having less ammo, you will have less supply to defend against zombies using your guns. | Different ammunition such as 5.56, 7.62mm, 9mm etc. |
|c Food         | Each case will feed someone on your population daily. Without enough food, the people on your [[Homesites|homesite]] will become hungry and may get sick, eventually dying. | Coffee, snacks |
|c Fuel         | Used for setting up traps, firecrackers and the like. Contrary to what its in-game descriptions says, it's not used on cars (all cars on the game have unlimited fuel). | Molotovs |
|c Materials    | Mainly used in the maintenance and building of facilities in your [[Homesites|homesite]]. 1 Material resource is expended for every [[Outposts|outpost]] you have. | Melee weapons |
|c Medicine     | Represents the number of people on your [[Homesites|homesite]] that are sick, hurt or injured and needs medicine. | Different medicines such as Aspirin, Codeine etc. |

==Outposts==

Outposts are structures that act as protection for your [[Homesites|homesites]] against [[Setting traps|incoming zombie hordes]] as well as to transfer items from the supply locker. Having outposts increases the daily consumption of the Material resource cache by 1 for every outposts you own. You can have a minimum of 2 outposts and a maximum of 8 outposts, which are determined based on how large your homesite is. You can setup an outpost without a [[Resource caches|resource cache]], but this does not reduce the daily consumption of any resource cache. It will just be treated as an outpost for incoming zombie hordes and a place to transfer items from your supply locker.

Abandoning outposts is done in the journal. Simply select the outpost you want to give up and wai   for 1 minute. When the outpost is abandoned, it will be treated as a structure with ''Nothing Left''. Zombies are now able to spawn there and can also be home for new infestations.

===Creating outposts===

Creating outposts is issued by the radio command ''Establish Outpost'' (costs 50 [[Influence|Influence]]). The structure to be created as an outpost must be clear of zombies and freaks and that it is fully searched.

An outpost with a [[Resource caches|resource cache]] reduces daily consumption of that resource by 3. To do this, you must always leave behind a resource cache on the structure you are looting at. For example, if you found a Food resource on a refrigerator of a house, don't pick it up or never call a survivor to pick it up for you. Instead, leave it behind and establish the outpost.

Outposts can only have 1 type of resource cache. In case there is more than 1 type of resource cache in the structure you want to build an outpost to, the game will use the first resource available in alphabetical order. For example, you found Fuel and Material resources on a Warehouse structure. If you establish an outpost with these two resources available, the game will use the Fuel resource because it comes first alphabetically. If you want to use the Material resource for the structure, remove the Fuel resource from its storage then establish the outpost.

===Setting traps===

Traps are used to destroy zombie hordes automatically. They will recharge after 10 real-time minutes. You can increase the safe zone radius of all outposts by selecting any outpost from your journal, then selecting the action ''Set traps for passing hordes'' (costs 1 Fuel, 1 [[Influence|Influence]]). This effect lasts for 2 real-time hours.

===Tips on deploying outposts efficiently===

The main purposes of outposts is to destroy incoming hordes with ease as well as provide an area for you to restock and resupply your inventory. Deploying outposts mainly depends on how you want to play your game, whether you like to have zombie hordes near your homesite or not. The safe zone radius of each outposts signify that zombies cannot spawn inside. To increase this radius, you need to issue the [[Setting traps|set traps action]] from your journal. Here are some guidelines to consider when creating outposts:

*Consider structures with intersecting roads - a good example of this is in Marshall (found at the southwest corner of the map). If your homesite is either on the [[Savini Residence|Savini Residence]] or on the [[Snyder Trucking Warehouse|Snyder Trucking Warehouse]], you can create your outposts on the structures near the bridges that connects the west and east Marshall together. The paths between the bridges have intersections that can be used to prevent zombie spawns and destroy passing zombie hordes easily.
*Create outposts near the homesite - this prevents zombie hordes from attacking your [[Homesites|homesite]] as well as prevent zombie spawns depending on how large its safe zone radius is.
*Don't place outposts too near each other - you have to make good use of the safe zone radius that each outposts provide, coupled with the fact that you can increase this. Unless your homesite is located on [[The Alamo|The Alamo]], which is situated at the middle of east Marshall and very prone to zombie hordes, you can make use of that extra safe zone radius to protect other areas of the map. Even so, because the homesite only provides you with 4 outposts at a time.
*Pick structures with at least 1 resource cache - always create an outpost that contains a [[Resource caches|resource cache]] in it. This reduces daily consumption of that specific resource by 3. Remember that each outpost consumes 1 Material resource to maintain it. If you created an outpost with a Materials cache, you will get -2 daily consumption for the Material resource.
*Place outposts at the last structures of an area for scavenging - this is optional, but I prefer this myself because I do a lot of scavenging runs from different areas (as I don't fully scavenge each area while playing the story missions). You can set up outposts that will prevent infestations and zombie hordes from passing through that area, provided that you have cleared infestations on that area. For example, at Spencer's Mill, you can keep this area of hordes if you place an outpost on the north (the gas station, just before Mount Tanner), on the west (the vet clinic or the diner, I prefer the diner though because I can just increase its safe zone radius), and the east (the mini-mart or construction site - whichever will do). This tip is useful if you're situated at [[Snyder Trucking Warehouse|Snyder Trucking Warehouse]] because you can have 8 outposts at a given time. You can put three outposts at Spencer's Mill as I've mentioned above, two outposts that cover the bridges at Fairfield, and the last 3 outposts from the northeast (gas station), and the south sections that cover the bridges before east Marshall.

==Frequently Asked Questions==

*Q - Are the Commerce commands available for one time use only?
**A - No. While playing the game, you'll occasionally receive prompts at the top-right corner of your screen that there is a temporary access available for use. You need to have the [[Library|Library]] facility to unlock the Commerce commands as well as do research. For example, if you have a [[Dojo|Dojo]] (which is an upgraded [[Training Area|Training Area]]), a Commerce command will appear occasionally letting you train outsiders to gain 2 Ammo upon completion.

*Q - Can I adjust the maximum number of outposts?
**A - Technically, no. However, if have modding knowledge, you can change the number of outposts you can have at one time by downloading certain tools to be able to extract the game's files and editing them.

*Q - How do I relocate to another homesite?
**A - You must first complete the story mission ''Home Away From Home''. This will unlock the radio command ''Relocate Home Base'', which is used to relocate to another homesite. Note that you can only relocate to structures that are marked ''Potential Home Site''. Doing so on other structures is not possible.

*Q - Why does my outpost have a green-colored fort icon instead of icons of a resource cache?
**A - If your [[Outposts|outpost]] has a fort icon, it means you established an outpost without leaving a [[Resource caches|resource cache]] behind. An outpost without any resource cache does not reduce daily consumption of your resources. It only acts as protection against hordes and as a way to resupply your items without the need to go to your homesite. To create an outpost with a resource cache, make sure to leave it on the container you're searching at then [[Creating outposts|establish the outpost]] after clearing the structure of zombies.

*Q - Why don't I see the repair commands on the Parking facilities?
**A - You'll only see these commands if you have a vehicle correctly parked at the respective [[Parking|parking space]] and that it is sufficiently damaged. There are many factors that vehicles can be damaged such as constantly running over zombies and ramming it on indestructible structures (eg. fences, rocks, and trees). They don't have any completion time, so as long as you have sufficient Material resources, it will automatically repair your vehicle, depending on which repair command you used.

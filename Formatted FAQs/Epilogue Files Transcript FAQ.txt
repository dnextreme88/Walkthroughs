==Introduction==

Hi and welcome to my Epilogue Files Transcript FAQ for Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. This guide will simply list the contents of the transcript of each dialogues you get when you finish the game. It's worth reading them because they provide an overview of what happened to the characters surrounding Raccoon City and the virus outbreak. I copied the contents of these verbatim, meaning, to how they are worded when viewing them.

==The Epilogue Files==

The epilogue files were added to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis as a means of closing the door on Raccoon City.  This was late 1999 and Code: Veronica hadn't quite been introduced yet, while the concept of Outbreak was years away from completion.  Thus, this set of follow-ups focused primarily on the loose ends from Nemesis, RE2, and the original RE1.

There were 8 files in all. Each time you complete the game in ''Hard Mode'', assuming you used the same block of data, a new file would be unlocked, regardless of any ranking during gameplay or usage of items opened up by the Mercenaries mini-game.

All epilogue files are directly written verbatim. Mistakes such as "'''used be'''" in [[Epilogue #7: Ada Wong|Epilogue #7]] are directly copied from the game.

===Epilogue #1: Jill Valentine===

''Background Picture'': Jill crouching in a room, holding a bloody knife.

=-----=
After escaping the city, Jill set out to join Chris Redfield. However, all she found was an empty hideout of Chris's. On the floor was Chris's knife. Jill left without hesitation because she firmly believes that Chris is still alive. She will search for him until she finds him. Then they can go and put an end to Umbrella...

===Epilogue #2: Chris Redfield===

''Background Picture'': Chris sitting at a table as a woman passes by.

"Please forgive me Claire." Chris Redfield has just finished this letter with his signature phrase. As he removes his sunglasses, a lady walks by him with light steps. "She looks about the same age as Claire," he thinks. A short time later, Chris discovered that his sister was looking for him, but was caught...

===Epilogue #3: Barry Burton===

''Background Picture'': Barry hugging one of his daughters, while his wife and her other daughter looks on.

=-----=
Barry Burton looks at his young daughters and says, "I'm sorry but my comrades are waiting for me." He knows that he must repay his teammates for forgiving his betrayal. Even if that means leaving his family for now. His wife tries to hide her fear, so she smiles and says, "Don't worry. We'll be OK..."

''Background Picture'': Leon sitting on a bed, clinching his fists while watching a man drink coffee.

=-----=
Leon Scott Kennedy is confronted with a man who claims to be a US government agent. Leon says, "Leave Sherry alone. She is innocent." "She knows too much," the man replies. He looks at Leon and says, "But you have value. This is a good deal. Make your choice." Without regret or hesitation, Leon closes his eyes and then sharply responds...

===Epilogue #5: Claire Redfield===

''Background Picture'': Claire walking away from Leon and Sherry on a highway while holding a knife.

=-----=
"Leave us alone." Claire Redfield couldn't believe Leon's words. Leon continued, "You're looking for your brother, right? Just go!"

===Epilogue #6: Sherry Birkin===

''Background Picture'': Sherry sitting on a desk by the window while a man interrogates her.

===Epilogue #8: Hunk===

''Background Picture'': Hunk holding a mask in a helicopter.

=-----=
"Once again, only you survived, Mr. Death," the chopper pilot speaks with a cold bitterness. "Always, only you, survive, Mr. Death," the pilot continues. But Hunk does not respond to the pilot. He doesn't care. "The Death cannot die...," the survivor thinks to himself with a warm smile...

Buy the "Map of George's Baseball Cards" for $1,200 at a General Shop to see all the locations of the Baseball Cards.

All of these Baseball Cards are found on Whitetail Mountains. Unlike other collectibles, you get to keep the baseball cards after completing the mission.

*Cooper Cabin - found inside the cabin. Go to the room on your right with the overturned bed. The baseball card is found on a wall shelf.

*F.A.N.G. Center - found inside the convenience store on the side of the shelf that is empty.

*McNeill Residence - found on one of the cabins just outside of the house. Go inside and look for a table on your left upon entering. It is just above the note you can read.

The following are unmarked locations on the map (you can't fast travel to them if you have discovered them earlier).

*Unmarked cabin - on your map, look for a gray bridge southeast of the ''F.A.N.G. Center''. Now turn your attention to a road that has a dead end (it is the one surrounded by trees). Go to this location. Get inside the cabin and the baseball card will be on top of the brown couch. If you have already started the mission by talking to George Wilson prior to going here, this location will be automatically marked.

*Unmarked cabin - on your map, look for a location named ''"Cedar Lake"''. There is somewhat a road northwest of this location. Set foot on the path via helicopter or boat and look for a cabin on the east. The baseball card is found inside the cabin, on a dresser.

*Unmarked cabin - on your map, look for a cabin on the north. If you are playing the mission ''"Radio Silence"'', you should locate this easily as it's just before the north aerial tower you are supposed to destroy. Inside the cabin, the baseball card is found on the desk to your left immediately upon entering.

*Unmarked shed - on your map, look for a small shed south of ''PIN-K0 Radar Station'' and northwest of ''Jefferson Lookout Tower''. It's better to use a helicopter here so you can find it easier. Enter the small shed and the baseball card is found on the wall shelf to your left.

*Unmarked gas station - on your map, look for a gray bridge with a location named ''"Widow's Creek"''. On the intersection, there is a path going west and north. Take the north path and find the gas station by the west. This is south of ''Silver Lake Parking Lot'' and north of ''Dylan\'s Master Bait Shop''. Go inside and the baseball card is found under a wooden sign that says "CLOTHING".

*Unmarked trailer - on your map, navigate through ''Baron Lumber Mill''. Follow the dirt road up north then head east and look for trailer near piles of logs. Go inside the trailer and the baseball card is found on a wall shelf below the Hope County Cougars sign.

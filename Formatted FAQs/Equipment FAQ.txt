==Equipment Capabilities==

Not every character in Golden Sun can equip certain armors and weapons. For instance, take Isaac as an example. Isaac seems to be the warrior type of the group and it is just fitting that he equips weapons fit for a fighter - axes, swords etc. Here is a list of what each character is capable of equipping:

''ARMORS:''

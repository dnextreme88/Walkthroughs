A. Story Quests [STO]

These dialogues are from the main story quests. Dialogues in parenthesis are
mentioned by the characters but don't appear on the screen. Some words contain
profanity.

+++++++++++++++++++
- Awakening [STO-1]
+++++++++++++++++++

GRE: Hud activated. Commence briefing.
Pilot: Approaching Harran.
GRE: Data on the subject. Kadir Suleiman. A local political figure hired to
maintain order after the outbreak. His brother Hassan died in a disease-related
incident before we were able to evacuate him.
GRE: Suleiman blamed the GRE for Hassan's death. He stole a highly sensitive
file which became his bargaining chip against the GRE.
GRE: With instructions to publicize it if anything happened to him.
GRE: Data on the subject. The stolen file. It details the incomplete process of
synthesizing a cure for the virus. If implemented in its current state, the
produced substance may be extremely toxic.
Pilot: Jump in ten seconds.
Pilot: Now!
GRE: Also, the file contains a full description of the virion structure. Any
attempt to use it would result in countless lives lost. It must be recovered.
GRE: Further information. Current status.
GRE: Suleiman sent the file to an associate unknown to us, with instructions to
publicize it at his command at any time.
GRE: To counter that, we instituted a city-wide communication jam, preventing
him from publicizing the file.
GRE: Your GRE-issued radio can overcome that jamming. It is your lifeline. Do
not lose it.
GRE: Suleiman has since gone underground and begun using a different name. We
have reason to believe he now leads one of the two main factions operating
within the city.
GRE: You are to find Suleiman and locate the stolen file in order to save
mankind from a disaster of unprecedented proportions.

------------------------------
After Crane lands on the Slums
------------------------------
Rais' soldier: I told you that wasn't a normal drop chute.
Tahir: Break his legs. Then take him to Rais.
Crane: Back up. All of you.
Tahir: Stop! Loud noises draw them!
Tahir: Fall back! FALL BACK!
Amir: Come on. We have to move.
Jade: Let's get him off the street.
Amir: GET THE DOOR OPEN!
Jade: Amir! NO!
Amir: Go! RUN!!
Jade: Tower, this is Jade. Get Sickbay ready. Got a guy with a bad head
wound... and a bite on one arm.
Rahim: Oh, sh*t! Amir's hurt?
Jade: No. Amir is gone... But I'm bringing in someone who might still survive.
Rahim: One of us?
Jade: We'll see.

----------------------
Waking up on The Tower
----------------------
Girl: You pinch him.
Boy: You're scared.
Girl: I'm not scared.
Boy: Then pinch him.
Girl: He blinked!
Boy: What?
Girl: He blinked again!
Boy: What if he's a zombie?!
Girl: Aaaaaaa!
Boy: Zombie! Run!
Crane: Sh*t... my head...

Guard: You sleep for three days like a dead man, then scare children? Off to a
great start, 31.
Crane: Where am I?
Guard: In paradise, can't you see?
Guard: Okay, enough joking around. Head to room 190. The boss'll brief you.
Crane: What do you mean, "31"?
Guard: Ask the boss!

Aman: And you are...?
Crane: Crane. Uh... 31.
Aman: Oh. Right. How's your head?
Crane: My head?
Aman: Got it. Listen up: until the boss says so, you are not on the list. So go
talk to him ASAP, and let's get things moving. Now, if you'll excuse me.

Crane: Hey, I'm looking for... are you the boss?
Rahim: What, am I too young? You got a problem with my age?
Crane: No, I... you wanted to talk to me.
Rahim: That's better. Do you remember anything? Know where you are?
Crane: (Yeah, yeah.) I can see this is... some kind of shelter?
Rahim: We call it "The Tower". Brecken and his runners put it all together a
couple of months ago, and we've been here ever since.
Rahim: Hunting air drops, scavenging... and rescuing people.
Crane: Yeah... I wanted to thank that girl...
Rahim: Good. Because if not for her, you'd already be chewing somebody's knee
bone. Your Antizin was totally crushed, by the way.
Rahim: Only thing Jade could salvage was your radio.
Crane: Great... so can I get that back, please?
Rahim: Actually, I think I need it more than you do.
Crane: Believe me, pal, that's not the case.
Rahim: Fine. Take it.
Rahim: You know why runners put their lives in danger? For guys like you.
Rahim: So now you take the Antizin meant for someone else, and you won't even
share your gear with us?
Rahim: I don't have time to deal with your bullsh*t.
Rahim: I've lost contact with one of our guys, thanks to the f*ck*d-up radios
we're stuck with.
Rahim: Do something for me, would you? I don't want to see you or your precious
radio anymore, so go be useful somewhere else.
Rahim: We don't tolerate lazy *ssholes here in the Tower.
Crane: Hey. Be fair. I'm not lazy, I'm just...
Crane: Hey, Boss...
Rahim: Save it. That lost guy I mentioned? He's only on the 13th floor, but he
might as well be trapped in a mine cave-in. Come back later.
Rahim: And I'm not the boss. Too young, remember? I'm Rahim. Brecken's in
charge here.
Timur: Where do you think you're going?
Rahim: The 13th floor. I'm getting some stuff for Rahim.
Timur: 13... ? Sh*t. That's gonna be some dirty work. But we all gotta pull our
weight around here, huh?

----------
13th floor
----------
Crane: Jesus... how many people died here... ?
Crane: Crane here.
GRE: Where were you? We've been waiting for your report. It's been over 70
hours.
Crane: Lost my radio for a while. Don't worry, my cover's intact. No contact
with the Tower's leader yet. Unable to confirm identity. I'm taking steps to
blend in.
GRE: Acknowledged. Time is of the essence, Crane. Remember that.
Crane: There's one more thing. I... got bitten. I've shown no symptoms, but the
people here say I'm infected.
GRE: ...Then you'd better get your hands on some Antizin ASAP, hadn't you?
Survivor: Help! HELP! Somebody!
Crane: What the hell?

------------------
Helping a survivor
------------------
Crane: Jesus... You all right, man?
Mark: I cut my arm... getting away from him... Oh, God... you had to kill him,
didn't you? God damn it...
Mark: That was... that was my brother... I came down to see him and...
Crane: Easy. Easy. It's all right now... I'll get help.
Crane: Rahim, this is Crane. I'm down here on 13. Listen, this guy of yours got
f*ck*d up pretty bad getting away from a zombie.
Rahim: Oh sh*t... 31?! You went after Mark? Is it... is it safe down there?
Crane: It's safe enough now.
Rahim: Okay, don't move! I'm sending Lena downstairs.
Crane: Hold still. Lena will be here any minute.
Mark: Gauze... You gotta find some gauze... And alcohol.
Mark: Combine them... That'll stop the bleeding... Please... hurry!
Crane: Try to stay calm, OK? I'll be right back.

Crane: Okay, I think that's everything I'm going to find. Let's give this a
shot.
Lena: Okay, who's hurt?
Crane: He's bleeding pretty bad.
Lena: Let me see him... Gauze and alcohol, huh? Pretty primitive, but it'll
work.
Lena: Thanks for the help, I'll take care of him from here.
Timur: Well done, 31.
Rahim: Hey, 31! Not bad for a new guy. Perhaps I misjudged you.
Crane: Hey, I just want to help out and repay you guys for what you did for me.
Rahim: Well, good. Come find me and we'll talk about how you can do that.

-------------------
At Brecken's office
-------------------
Crane: All right-taken care of. Piece of cake. What else you got for me?
Rahim: Well... Let me think.
Jade: Rahim, you are just smart enough to be dangerous, you know that? Omar
told me about your plans for the nest. Explosive charges? REALLY?
Rahim: What? Explosives? I never said that!
Jade: Oh, please. You can't tell a convincing lie to save your life.
Rahim: I know what I'm doing!
Jade: Yeah? You think you can't die?
Rahim: You're not my mom!
Jade: No. I'm not. Our mom's dead. So you might want to be a little nicer to me
since I'm the only family you have left... especially now that Amir's gone.
Crane: You're Jade, right?
Jade: Right...
Crane: I just wanted to thank you for what you did for me... and tell you how
sorry I am for your loss. I owe you and Amir my life.
Jade: Yeah, you do. You want to return the favor? Keep my dipsh*t brother from
killing himself!
Jade: NO EXPLOSIVES, Rahim.
Rahim: So...
Crane: So. Was that enough? Do I get to talk to Brecken now?
Rahim: First, go change your clothes. I left some new ones in your room. You're
in 194.
Crane: Something wrong with what I'm wearing?
Rahim: You need something that fits the job Brecken wants you to do. Call me
when you've changed.

--------------------
After changing gears
--------------------
Crane: Okay, Rahim, I'm ready. Where do I find Brecken?
Rahim: Not so fast, 31. If you're gonna earn your keep, we have to find out if
you've got the skills. So get your ass up to the gym.
Crane: Gym? What're you talking about?
Rahim: It's on the top floor... just a couple flights up.

--------------
At the rooftop
--------------
Crane: Rahim? I don't see you. Where are you?
Rahim: Close.
Rahim: You ought to feel right at home - a Crane on a crane!
Crane: Jesus, Mary and Joseph... I should be wearing a parachute for this...

Rahim: Welcome to our gym. First things first: you've got to learn how to run.
Crane: What do you mean, "learn how to run"?
Rahim: Just do what I say, all right? Now. Jump down to the very bottom.
Crane: Are you nuts? I'd kill myself!
Rahim: Don't be a wimp.
Crane: Come on! You can't be serious!
Rahim: Watch this.
(Rahim: Woohoo! Hoo!)
Rahim: Aaagh! AAAHH! My LEG!
Crane: Rahim! Jesus! Don't move, I'll get help!
Rahim: (Haha!) I was just f*ck*ng with you.
Crane: Son of a B*TCH.
Rahim: What, you can't take a joke? Come on! Get your ass down here!
Crane: Christ on a crutch...
Crane: Holy sh*t. Holy SH*T!
Rahim: It's a rush, isn't it? But don't blow your load just yet. There's more.
Rahim: To survive outside you gotta take advantage of the terrain. Most eaters
suck at climbing, so the harder the terrain is, the better for you.
Rahim: I've got some typical situation set up for you. Let's see how you handle
them.
Rahim: Sometimes it's better to crawl through the low, narrow passages.
Eaters'll have a tough time following you.
Rahim: Try not to slow down once you start running. Outside, if you stop -
you're probably dead.
Rahim: Not bad... for a noob!
Rahim: All right, get up on that scaffold. And don't fall, 'cause there sure as
hell ain't no net.
Rahim: That's my favorite: cat grab and muscle-up. You won't survive outside
for ten minutes if you can't do that.
Rahim: Good job!
Rahim: OK, time for the real test! Get back to the crane - make use of anything
and everything while you run!
Rahim: Ok, that's enough. You've got some serious natural talent, man. Either
that, or you've done this before. You done this before?
Crane: Hardly. Closest I ever came to this was running track in high school.
Rahim: Well then you're a f*ck*ng prodigy. Never seen anything like it.

(Crane: What's happening to me!? Sh*t! Sh*t!)
Rahim: Crane?
Rahim: Crane! Talk to me! What's going on?
Crane: Something... went wrong... Rahim, what just happened to me?
Rahim: Oh, sh*t... I bet you're having your first seizure, Just get back over
here.
Crane: Rahim, what the f*ck was that?! Does this mean I'm... turning?
Rahim: Most likely no. At least not yet. Seizures remind you that you're
infected. You better go see Dr. Zere, though. He'll check you out, probably
give you a shot of Antizin.
Rahim: Before you head out to see Zere, talk to the quartermaster. He'll gear
you up so you can go outside without getting your head bitten off.

-------------
Quartermaster
-------------
Quartermaster: Ohhh, you're the new scout? Rahim radioed me about you.
Crane: (Yeah.) That's me. Name's Crane.
Quartermaster: I'm not gonna bother learning your name till you've survived a
few days. But here, this is for you.
Quartermaster: By the way... Word around the Tower is you're just another
deadbeat in line for food or Antizin.
Quartermaster: By which I mean, the people here don't much like you. But don't
blame them. It's easy to get paranoid when you're isolated...
Quartermaster: ...and since somebody's jamming communications to the outside,
there's plenty of paranoia to go around.
Quartermaster: Whole d*mn city with nobody to call for help but ourselves.
Quartermaster: You bring me some supplies from the air drops though, and you'll
see people change their tunes in a hurry. That sh*t's a game-changer.
Crane: Thanks. I'll bear that in mind. Is there anything else? I'm in a bit of
a rush...
Quartermaster: Also, if you're looking to get more popular, you can try helping
folks. Do a few favors, they might like you more.
Quartermaster: Might even find a woman, keep you warm at night. Hahahaha!
Guard: Going outside, huh?
Guard: Okay, new guy. Be careful out there. We've lost too many already.
Rahim: Okay, newb, we've got Dr. Zere set up in a semi trailer on a fenced-in
playing court.
Rahim: When you leave the Tower, hang a left and head due south. You can't miss
it.
Rahim: It's Crane, kid.
Rahim: All right, all right, CRANE, just keep moving. There's no time to take
in the sights.
Rahim: And try not to make too much noise. Sound attracts those f*ck*rs.

--------
Dr. Zere
--------
Crane: Doctor? Hello? Anybody there?
Zere: Camden? Are you there? Camden! ... Dammit.
Crane: Uh... so, I'm supposed to get a vaccine...
Zere: What? No, no. Suppressant. It's called Antizin. Suppresses the symptoms.
Here, sit.
Zere: Antizin postpones the inevitable. Best the GRE could do.
Crane: Inevitable? So... there's no cure?
Zere: It's a variation of rabies. There's no cure right now, but you see, I've
been running tests on both Antizin and infected tissue.
Zere: A cure is... possible. Definitely possible.
Crane: No sh*t? You really think you can figure it out?
Zere: With Dr. Camden's help, yes, I think so. Uh. Now where did I put that
injector... ?
Crane: Who's Dr. Camden?
Zere: A colleague. Trapped in Sector 0 - where the outbreak first... well,
broke out. We've been collaborating via radio.
Zere: Though we would have made more progress if the connection were better.
Zere: Also if my earlier experiments had borne fruit. I tried injecting
recombined versions of the virus into chunks of meat and leaving them around
the city.
Zere: Hoping some of the infected would eat them, so I could observe and
document the results...
Crane: But they didn't?
Zere: It bore no fruit. I'm ashamed that I wasted so much time on it. No reason
to hold any Antizin in reserve now, in any case...
Zere: All right! I'm quite busy1 So on your way, now!
Zere: What was I doing?
Crane: Rahim - Zere checked me out, and gave me another shot.
Rahim: Okay, great. That ought to hold you for a while. Which is good, 'cause
I'm starting to get used to the idea of bossing you around.
Rahim: So! Time for a real trial! Go talk to Spike. You'll find him near Zere's
truck. He's got your first real job for you.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- First Assignment [STO-2]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Crane: Spike? I'm Crane.
Spike: Just what I need. More unskilled labor. All right, shut up and pay
attention: there are two types of airdrops. One has food, first aid supplies,
survival gear and such.
Spike: The other kind is filled with Antizin. The GRE sends in a one-way video
feed that lets us know when they're on the way.
Spike: Look, the trouble is, the airdrops with Antizin keeps getting raided by
Rais's thugs. And without Antizin we are basically screwed.
Spike: Rais and his boys only operate during the day, because going out after
dark is a dandy way to get killed.
Spike: But the next two Antizin drops are coming down right at sunset tonight,
and Brecken means to go after them. This may be our only chance to reach the
airdrop.
Crane: What's my part here?
Spike: Well, as I said, going out at night is basically suicide... or it would
be, if I hadn't been setting up safe zones and traps out there for weeks now.
Which I have.
Spike: Brecken and his team will be okay tonight-so long as you get out there
now and arm those traps. THAT'S your part.
Crane: All right, what are these traps, and how do I arm them?
Spike: You'll see. I'll be talking you through it. Just remember... without
these traps, Brecken won't survive the night. And if he doesn't come back with
Antizin, we are lost.
Spike: Before you head out there, grab some firecrackers. Made them myself.
They make a fine distraction if you get in trouble.

Spike: OK, first - the car. Open the hood and connect the battery. That'll arm
the trap.
Jade: Jade here. Is anyone outside right now? Urgent help needed.
Crane: Uhm... I'm outside. Working for Spike...
Jade: You're Crane, right? Listen... Our runners's trying to secure one of our
safe houses for Brecken's mission.
Jade: He's in a courtyard by Vefa and Mirmar, surrounded by zombies. We gotta
help him!
Crane: All right, I'm on it...

------
Virals
------
Crane: Okay Jade, I'm here... along with some Infected.
Jade: Watch yourself, Crane!
Crane: Oh, man... I think it's too late for this guy.
Jade: Sh*t. All right. Finish it. Just... don't let him suffer.
Crane: Okay. It's done. F*CK.
Jade: You had no choice. He wasn't human anymore. Now, hurry.
Jade: You still need to turn on the lights. That's the only way to make the
place safe at night.
Crane: Ah, sh*t.
Jade: How's it coming? Got the lights on?
Crane: Um. Almost. Just give me a second.
Crane: Crane here.
GRE: Report.
Crane: Okay, I met this doctor. A scientist type. They've got him set up in a
sort of research trailer, and he's working on a cure for the virus. His name is
Zere.
Crane: Hello? Do you copy?
GRE: Affirmative. Secondary objective added. Maintain your cover, and secure
all of his research. Acknowledge.
Crane: Your stolen file still takes top priority, though, right?
GRE: Affirmative. We find it unlikely that a single researcher working out of a
"trailer" could produce any significant results. But if he does, we want to see
it.
Crane: Jade? It's done.
Jade: Good. We'll need to prepare more places like that one.
Jade: We've got more spots picked out for future safe zones. Spike will mark
them on your map later.
Jade: And... Crane? Thank you... Back to you, Spike!
Spike: Right now you need to get back to our main task and arm the next trap.
There's another car close by.
Crane: Got it.

Crane: The infected're all over the street.
Spike: So what does that tell you? Keep off the street! Try to stay on the
rooftops where they can't reach you.
Crane: They're all around the car, Spike.
Spike: You still have some firecrackers, don't you? Just throw some into the
crowd. Those dead b*st*rds are easily distracted.
Crane: All done with the car, Spike.
Spike: Keep on like that and you might just make it. The next trap's close by.
Spike: And I shouldn't have to tell you, but: don't get caught out in the open!
Crane: Spike, these freaks are everywhere. If I need to use a trap, how do I
activate it?
Spike: You can't. I told you, they're only for the night mission.
Crane: Sh*t. Okay.

Crane: Quite a contraption you got here.
Spike: Three times brighter than an ordinary street lamp. Gives the infected
quite the sunburn.
Crane: Okay, lights are all set.
Spike: You're ready for the next one, then. Better hurry.
Rahim: Hey, Crane, guess what? I'm up on a balcony, and I got eyes on you from
here. Looks like you're doing okay. For a newbie.
Crane: Gee, thanks.
Rahim: Just try and get back here in one piece, all right? I don't wanna have
to train somebody to replace you.

------------------------------
Turning on the last light trap
------------------------------
Crane: F*ck. Spike, the whole godd*mn district went down. What the hell's going
on?!
Spike: Ugh... not again... All right, listen. There's a power substation near
you. Go check it out.
Spike: Hey-this blackout has really put us in a tight spot.
Spike: We're defenseless here, plus the safe zones and some of my traps are
down, too.
Spike: We need to get the power up and running ASAP.
Crane: I'm going as fast as I can, Spike.

Crane: F*ck! What is this... ?!
Crane: All right, I've got the substation reset. But if the grid shorted out
once, you know it could happen again, right?
Spike: You leave the electrical engineering to me, okay? Just get your ass to a
safe zone. You're gonna have to spend the night there.

--------------
At a safe zone
--------------
Crane: Oh sh*t-
Crane: What the f*ck is that?
Crane: Hey-Doc? This is Kyle Crane.
Zere: Crane? What can I do for you?
Crane: I just saw this freaking weird zombie covered in big green blisters. It
hauled ass as soon as it spotted me. Do you know anything about it?
Zere: Hmm. Not enough information, I'm afraid. But if you see another one, do
let me know, will you?

Spike: Crane, you awake?
Crane: Spike? What's going on?
Spike: Something bad happened. We need to talk.
Crane: Okay, give me a sec.

-----
Spike
-----
Crane: Spike - what's up?
Spike: Crane, first of all... you did great out there!
Spike: From now on, if you need something, come see me. And to start with...
Spike: Here's a UV flashlight and a remote control. You run up on a volatile,
give him a face full of UV-or lead him into a trap, which you (can) trigger
with the remote. Got it?
Crane: Got it.
Spike: Perfect. Now for the bad news: despite your efforts, Brecken's mission
failed.
Crane: Sh*t... is he okay?
Spike: He's alive. But you need to get back to the Tower. Jade called all the
Scouts in, and that means you.
Crane: Okay. Wonder if I'll finally get to meet Brecken in person?

Crane: Crane here.
GRE: Report.
Crane: I'm about to have a meeting with the Tower's leader.
GRE: Acknowledged. Confirm his identity and contact us immediately.

-------
Brecken
-------
Jade: Crane.
Jade: Listen: Brecken and a team of runners went after an air drop last night.
Jade: He lost the rest of the team to biters, and then Rais's men ambushed him,
beat him to a pulp, and stole the drop.
Jade: Now Brecken wants to go after the next drop himself, but we can't let
him. And you've got to back me up. Ok?
Lena: For God's sake, you can't even walk straight! We need you alive, you
idiot!
Jade: Okay, we're going in. Act confident.
Jade: Brecken. Lena.
Lena: Maybe you can get through to him!
Jade: Jade. Who's your friend?
Crane: Kyle Crane.
Jade: Look, Brecken, the last thing we need is for you to go back out there. We
can figure out another way. Without jeopardizing you. Right, Crane?
Crane: I'll go. I'll do it.
Jade: Right! Yes! Crane will go. He'll be happy to.
Brecken: Jesus. No offense, friend, but you're as green as grass. You can't
just-
Jade: Crane will manage. He'll start in the right spot. And Lena's right: you
need to be here, taking care of the Tower.
Jade: Convincing them the world's not over yet.
Brecken: Ah, hell. Maybe... one more try before we go to Rais. Yeah... okay.
Fine.
Brecken: Good luck... Crane.
Brecken: Jade. A moment?
(Jade: Sure.)
Jade: Head for the Cauldron. I'll be in touch shortly.
Lena: Look, there's something else we need to discuss. Brecken was hurt pretty
badly out there. Worse than he wants people to know.
Lena: He took a blow to the head. Now he's starting to have seizures, and I
don't have any Loratrax.
Crane: I doubt anyone does. Anti-seizure drugs were being passed out like candy
when the infection first started. The stores ran out weeks ago.
Lena: Yes, that's right. How'd you know that?
Crane: What do you need me to do, Lena?
Lena: There's a man in town named Gazi. He's not all together there, if you
know what I mean.
Lena: His mother had epilepsy, so he used to pick up medicine for her each
month.
Lena: She died two years ago, but Gazi kept going to the store to pick up her
prescription.
Lena: He likes his routine, and Gazi can be very... Insistent. So they kept
giving it to him.
Crane: You think he's been stockpiling it all this time?
Lena: If he hasn't I don't know where else we're going to get it from.
Lena: Gazi lives under the overpass.
Lena: And don't mention his mother's death. He won't understand.

- Airdrop [STO-3]

*NOTE: This is a side quest. I felt the need to put it since Lena mentioned
about Gazi on the previous story quest.

Crane: Gazi? Are you there?
Gazi: If Mama ain't happy, nobody happy! So you'd better make Mama happy!
Crane: Gazi?
Gazi: Me too. We have the same name. Are you from the video store?
Crane: No, my name's Crane.
Gazi: Crane? Crane rhymes with train, and brain, and sane, and grain, and rain,
and plain, and the other kind of plane, and-
Crane: (Look.) Can I come in?
Gazi: No! It's impossible! Impossible! This is my special day with Mom.
Gazi: It's Mother's Day, and it's the most important day in the whole world.
Are you from the video store?
Crane: Why do you keep asking me that?
Gazi: Because you're supposed to bring my movie about me. It's called "Charly",
and it's all about me, and how smart I am.
Crane: Look, Gazi, if I bring you your movie, will you let me come in?
Gazi: Sure. You could watch with us. It's Mother's Day, and if Mama ain't
happy, nobody happy.
Gazi: Oh! And she also wants chocolate! Mama wants chocolate!
Crane: (No, no no.) Wait a minute. That's too much.
Gazi: Don't argue with Gazi. It doesn't work. That's what the drug store people
say.

Crane: Son of a b*tch, not now!
Crane: Charly, Charly... C for Charly...
Crane: Gotcha.

Gazi: Yes?
Crane: Here's your movie and your chocolates.
Gazi: Wait 'till mom see this! Gazi wins again! Hurray for Gazi!
Crane: Right.
Crane: Okay then, I'll just let myself in through the roof.
Crane: Hello, Gazi.
Gazi: Shhh! The movie is on. Mama's watching.

---------
The Tower
---------
Crane: I've got your anti-seizure medicine.
Lena: Thanks. How'd things go with Gazi?
Crane: He may be challenged, but he's very good at getting what he wants.
Lena: Did you meet his Mom?
Crane: Yeah, she seemed happy.
Lena: If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
Lena: Speaking of which, Brecken asked me to pass this on to you, with his
thanks.

Crane: Crane here.
GRE: Report.
Crane: The Tower boss is named Brecken, and he's definitely not your man.
Crane: The other likely suspect is this... warlord, basically. Local guy, calls
himself Rais.
Crane: He's hoarding Antizin and then gouging the hell out of anybody who wants
to buy some.
Crane: I'm on a mission to get Antizin from the air drop. If I don't succeed,
they'll have to come up with something else.
GRE: Acknowledged. Good job, Crane. You're doing well. Stay on task and we'll
be in touch.
GRE: Be sure to call us immediately if and when you get that Antizin.

Jade: Crane. Three-quarters of all airdrops fall in the Cauldron.
Jade: So if you start from there, you'll have the best chance of getting to
that drop before Rais's men do.
Crane: On my way.
Crane: Jade, I'm getting close to the drop zone.
Jade: Good. Find some shelter and wait. Most of the drops seem to fall exactly
in that area.
Crane: And there's a crate. It looks intact. I'll check out what's inside...
Crane: Dammit. Nothing here.
Jade: Did you see that?
Crane: Yeah, two drops.
Jade: They landed elsewhere unfortunately, but you're not that far away. Get to
those crates before anyone else does!

Crane: Sh*t... too late.
Crane: Jade, Rais's men got here first.
Jade: F*ck! Okay, don't try to fight them. Just find the second one. Look for
the smoke from the flare! The crate should be close by.
Jade: Crane, it's too close to sunset. You need to turn back. (Now!)
Crane: Jade, I'm almost there. I can do this.

Crane: Crane here. I'm about to recover an Antizin drop.
GRE: Good, Crane. This offers us a new strategy. Time to turn your attention to
Rais. Listen closely.
GRE: It's very possible that Rais is our man. So if you find an airdrop
containing Antizin, destroy it.
Crane: What?? Why?
GRE: It will force interaction with Rais. You can go under Brecken's auspices.
As an ambassador, if you will.
Crane: But-there are civilians depending on this stuff...
GRE: Our plan is focused on the greater good. Remember that.
Crane: Jade, I'm at the airdrop. There's no Antizin here.
Jade: NONE? F*ck... F*CK. All right, get back here. And be careful... the
nightmares are awake. Don't let them see you.
Crane: Oh Sh*t, must've heard me...

---------
The Tower
---------
Runner: Brecken, come on... I mean, we need Antizin, I know, but buying from
Rais? You can't be serious...
Jade: For God's sake, I'll go. I'm not scared.
Brecken: Absolutely not. We've discussed that already.
Jade: We didn't discuss it. You just decided that I-
Crane: I'll go.
Jade: Are you serious?
Crane: Well... this Rais guy has never seen my face before. Clean slate. Right?
Brecken: Could you guys give Crane and me the room, please?
Brecken: You sure you're up for this?
Crane: Has to be done, doesn't it?
Brecken: Well, I'm not gonna argue. Rais's place is over here. Just... find out
what this'll cost us, and come back in one piece.

++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Pact with Rais [STO-4]
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Jade: Crane. Can you hear me?
Crane: Jade? Yeah, I copy. Something wrong?
Jade: No, no... it's... Listen, Crane... We all appreciate what you're doing.
Jade: And I know you're doing it to redeem yourself... because Amir died saving
your life...
Crane: Look I'm doing it because if we don't get Antizin from Rais, people will
start to die...
Jade: (You know) I met Amir right after the outbreak. I didn't know him for
long, but... he was the best, most decent man I've ever known.
Jade: But I just want you to know that I don't blame you. Amir knew the risk.
Jade: And Crane... We know that you too are taking a risk to do this for us.
Crane: I... Look, Jade... we'll talk when I get back with the Antizin, okay?
Jade: Okay. Just... just come back in one piece, alright?

--------------
Rais' Garrison
--------------
Crane: Okay, Rahim, I'm here.
Rahim: Make sure they see you and know who you are. You don't want to sneak up
on them. That's a good way to catch a bullet.
Crane: Wish me luck, kid.
Rahim: Good luck, brother. You're going to need it.
Crane: Don't shoot! (Don't shoot!)
Guard: Hands up! What do you want, motherf*ck*r?
Crane: I'm here to see Rais. Brecken sent me.
Guard: Brecken? That *sshole in the Tower? All right, what does HE want?
Crane: I've come to make a deal.
Guard: What kinda deal?
Crane: The kind I make with Rais. Not with his flunkies.
Guard: ... All right. Let him through. This oughta be entertaining.

Rais: How long have we been friends, Osman?
Rais: We have been friends for a very long time. That is why I am so surprised
that you would steal from me.
Tahir: Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Rais: Now I give you a choice. Very simple. Your right hand? Or your left?
Osman: L-L-L-Left! ...
Rais: Hmmm... was that MY left, or YOUR left?
Rais: You have the look of the Tower about you. What do you want?
Crane: I'm here to make a deal.
Rais: A deal... for Antizin, no doubt. Desperate times.
Rais: And what do you offer in return? Your services? Your loyalty? ... Perhaps
I shall take both.
Tahir: Talk to Karim. He's one of ours. Do what he asks of you, and Rais will
consider giving your people some Antizin. Understood?
Crane: I don't seem to have a choice.
Rais: Perceptive.

Karim: There you are. Rais said you'd be coming by. I'm Karim.
Crane: Crane.
Karim: An American. I have an uncle there. Lives in Texas. You from Texas? You
a cowboy?
Crane: I'm from Chicago.
Karim: Okay, Al Capone, we'll be in constant contact over the radio. That way I
can make sure you get where you need to go.
Crane: And where's that exactly?
Karim: You're going to be climbing antenna towers and switching on shortwave
radio modulators.
Karim: Most of my men are too slow, too fat, or too drunk to climb a tower like
that without killing themselves.
Crane: And if I do this, I'll get the Antizin?
Karim: That's between you and Rais. I know better than to speak for him. Just
don't fail. He doesn't handle disappointment very well.

Crane: Crane.
GRE: Report.
Crane: Just met Rais. There's no question: that's Suleiman. Guy's a psychopath.
He's gone from ruthless politician to f*ck*ng warlord.
GRE: Is he aware of your affliation with us?
Crane: No. He think I'm just a guy from the Tower. In fact he's making me jump
through hoops before he'll give me any Antizin.
GRE: Acknowledged. Continue to do as he asks. Remember, we need that file.
Crane: Great. Crane out.

-----------
1st antenna
-----------
Karim: Hey, Al Capone, you ready to do this?
Crane: What exactly am I doing?
Karim: Radio communication has been pretty spotty in the quarantine.
Karim: These modulators will help boost the signal so Rais can communicate with
outposts at the far reaches of town.
Crane: That's a benefit for everyone-not just Rais.
Karim: Perhaps. But the emperor must monitor his empire.
Crane: Karim? I'm at the first antenna.
Karim: If the power's not on, you'll have to turn it on. There will be a switch
in the small building at the antenna's base.

Crane: What the WHAT THE HELL-!
Karim: Crane! Why are you shouting?
Crane: I'm shouting because this f*ck*d-up infected motherf*ck*r with guts
hanging out his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me!
Karim: ... Not a bad reason.

Crane: Oh, sh*t, Karim, someone already scavenged this thing for parts. There's
nothing up here to switch on.
Karim: F*ck... I was afraid of that. All right, head to the next antenna tower.
It's not too far from there.
Karim: Just use the zipline and head east. You'll see it.

-----------
2nd antenna
-----------
Crane: (Hey,) Karim, what do I do if the second transmitter is trashed?
Karim: The better question is, what will you do if you disappoint Rais? And the
answer is probably, "Die horribly".

Crane: Karim, I'm at the second antenna tower, and the fence is electrified. I
think someone's inside.
Karim: That will be Alexei. And perhaps his son, Kristov. I find them tiresome.
Karim: Don't let them stand in your way. You've got to get inside and turn on
that transmitter.
Alexei: What the f*ck do you want?
Crane: I need to climb the tower.
Alexei: Why the hell would you want to do that?
Crane: For Rais. He asked me to.
Alexei: Rais? (Hah!) You don't look like one of his crew.
Crane: Fine, I'll just radio back and tell Rais that you wouldn't let me
through.
Alexei: What? F*ck! No, I didn't say that! You want to climb? Fine. Go. Go.
(Kristov: I won't do this anymore!)
(Alexei: You better keep your voice down!)
(Kristov: I don't care who hears me!)
(Alexei: Kristov, what's wrong with you? We're trying to stay alive here.)
(Kristov: These guys are killers!)
(Alexei: Yes, they're murderers. That's why we stay safe.)

Crane: I sure hope this f*ck*ng climb was worth it.
Crane: And this thing's still intact. Let's see if it was worth the hassle...
Crane: Hey Karim, the second transmitter is up and running. Is it working?
Karim, do you hear me?
Karim: Loud and clear. Nice job. You know the way back, right?
Crane: Right.

Rahim: It was you, wasn't it?!
Crane: Rahim?
Rahim: The antennas! Brecken told me. Communication is crystal clear now!
Crane: Yeah, that was me. And now I'm on my way to see Rais again.
Rahim: And get the Antizin?
Crane: That's the deal.
Rahim: Good job, man. This helps everybody, but especially Dr. Zere and Dr.
Camden.
Rahim: They can hear each other without static for the first time since...
well, ever.
Rahim: See you back at the Tower!
Crane: I'll be there as soon as I can.
Spike: Hey! Crane! If you've got a second, I want to patch you through to
somebody who really wants to talk to you.
Crane: Huh? Who?
Troy: Is this Kyle Crane?
Crane: ... Who wants to know?
Troy: My name is Troy. I lead a small group of survivors over in Sector 0. We
call ourselves the Embers.
Troy: Sector 0 is completely sealed off, Mr. Crane, until you restored radio
communication, we didn't know if anyone else in the city was still alive.
Troy: I just wanted to let you know how grateful we are. You've given us a
small measure of hope.
Crane: Uh... well... I'm happy to help.
Troy: If there's ever any way we can help YOU, Mr. Crane, please don't hesitate
to ask.

--------------
Rais' Garrison
--------------
Rais: Well! You not only did the job Karim asked of you, but you made it back
in one piece. Bravo.
Crane: Can I get some Antizin now?
Rais: Did you think I would be satisfied so easily? You still have plenty to
prove.
Crane: Look... we really need the drugs. Let me have them now, and then I'll
come back and do whatever.
Rais: You'll get Antizin when I SAY you get it. Not one second before.
Rais: But as I have established, I am not unreasonable. Do all that I ask of
you, and I will give you not one... but two crates of Antizin.
Crane: All right. Fine. What do you want me to do?
Rais: This will be a bit different from your exploits on the antennas. It will
require a bit more... persuasion.
Rais: The imposing of one's will. The creation of one's own rules. That is what
makes a man.
Rais: Do you live by your own rules, Crane? Or are you merely someone else's
puppet? I believe I know the answer.
Rais: Talk to Karim, before I decide you are no longer worth the trouble.

Karim: Ah, my friend. Rais likes you, I can tell...
Crane: (Yeah?) How?
Karim: Because you are still among the living. The task at hand is as easy as
can be. You simply have to make a few pickups from some nearby settlements.
Crane: Which ones?
Karim: The first is Jaffar's Wheelstation. It's just east of here.
Karim: But bear in mind, not everyone you talk to today will be in a...
cooperative state of mind. I'm sure you can be convincing, though, no?
Crane: I guess I'll have to be.

Crane: Crane here.
GRE: Report.
Crane: Another job for Rais. This one's pretty dirty. He's forcing me to
collect the money he's extorting from a nearby village.
GRE: Just do what he asks and stay close to him. Remember what's at stake.
Crane: Yeah... Crane out.

---------------------
Jaffar's Wheelstation
---------------------
Crane: Karim? I'm by the Wheelstation.
Karim: Took you long enough. Get the job done, and make it fast. This is just
the first stop.
Crane: You Jaffar?
Jaffar: Who wants to know?
Crane: My name isn't important. What's important is that Rais sent me. And that
you owe him some money.
Jaffar: I've never seen you before. For all I know you're just some random
*sshole. F*ck off.
Crane: Tell you what. How about I break both your legs and drag you through the
streets back to Rais's place, huh? Then he can explain to you that you
should've cooperated.
Jaffar: Okay, okay, Jesus! You ARE one of Rais's thugs. You guys are the only
ones who'd act this sh*tty.
Jaffar: Here, here's your money, take it.
Crane: And if I have to come back here...
Jaffar: You won't get any more attitude! Mi casa, su casa. Just don't hurt me,
all right?
Crane: Karim, it's me. (So) I just threatened to break an old man's legs.
Karim: And it worked, didn't it? Next you collect the tribute from the
Fishermen's Village.
Karim: Head east, to the tunnel entrance. Their messenger always meets us
there.

Brecken: Crane. How you doing, mate?
Crane: I'm... running errands for Rais. He wields a lot of power. Scares a lot
of people.
Brecken: D*mn right, he does.
Brecken: Listen, mate, time's getting short. We're almost out of Antizin, and
much as I hate to admit it, I'm getting worried.
Crane: I'm doing the best I can out here, Brecken.
Brecken: I know. I know. I understand. I just want you to be aware of the
stakes.
Crane: I'm infected too, remember? Believe me, I'm motivated.
Brecken: All right... all right. Here's hoping you can make it back to the
Tower soon.

Crane: What the f*ck was that?!
Crane: (Hey!) Karim, I just saw something I've never seen before. This huge,
bloated Infected just f*ck*ng exploded!
Karim: Yeah, we call them bombers. Some of our guys use them to kill other
Infected.
Karim: Shoot them and they take out everything in a three-meter radius.
Crane: Are you kidding me?
Karim: Keep your distance and you'll be fine. But what about the courier? Was
he there?
Crane: No, I didn't see anybody, just f*ck*ng zombies.
Karim: All right. You'll have to go to the village directly, I suppose. Look
for a man named Gursel.

-------------------
Fishermen's Village
-------------------
Crane: Okay, Karim, I'm outside the village, but there's a whole horde of
Infected in there.
Karim: So clear them out. We get paid for protection. Do some protecting.
Crane: I don't know if I can take out that many by myself.
Karim: Sure you can. Because if you don't, you'll have to deal with Rais.
Karim: And you remember what I said about Rais when he's disappointed.

Crane: I gotta get that gate closed before more of those f*ck*rs get inside...
Fisherman: Ye... Yes? Who-who goes there?
Crane: I'm here on Rais's behalf. I'm supposed to pick something up.
Fisherman: Oh my God, that's one of Rais's men! What do I do?!
Woman: Just tell him to go away. Do it nice and maybe he'll leave us alone.
Better yet, send him to Gursel - he'll know what to do.
Fisherman: Please, we don't know anything. Go talk to Gursel, he lives above
the store.

Fisherman: Yeah?
Crane: Hey... Rais sent me here to pick something up for him.
Fisherman: You won't find it here... not here, not in this house.
Fisherman: Not anywhere around this house! Gursel! Gursel is the one you're
looking for!

Fisherman: Who is it?
Crane: Hey, I'm looking for someone in charge here. Rais sent me...
Fisherman: You want Gursel. Check the big house in the center of the village.
Fisherman: He lives upstairs. Just be careful around his woman. She's hell on
wheels.
Crane: Um... thanks...

Crane: Hey! Anybody in there?!
Gursel: (Sshh!) Not so loud. You'll draw the monsters.
Crane: (Look.) I got rid of them. But you better reinforce that gate before
more show up.
Gursel: You got rid of them? All of them?
Crane: Rais sent me. Are you Gursel?
Gursel: Oh - you work for Rais. Should've known this was too good to be true.
Ayla: You've taken enough! You can't have any more! Firkin, tell him!
Gursel: Ayla, please. Just let me talk to the man.
Ayla: You can't just push us around like this! Firkin's gonna kick your ass! Do
it, Firkin! Kick his ass!
Gursel: For God's sake, Ayla!
Gursel: Look, I don't want any trouble. But we already paid up this month.
You're gonna bleed us dry.
Crane: That is ENTIRELY not my problem. Rais wants his payment. So you make the
payment, or things get bad for you... AND your woman.
Ayla: You can't threaten us! Kick his ass, Firkin!
Gursel: GIVE ME A BREAK, Ayla! (Alright.) Fine. Here. This is all of it.
Ayla: Pfffft. A real man would've kicked his ass.
Crane: I'll leave you to it. Sounds like you have bigger problems than money.
Crane: Okay, Karim, I got Gursel's money. I f*ck*ng hate myself now, but I
got the money.
Karim: The self-hatred fades eventually. Just one pick-up to go, at the ferry
station on the old pier.
Crane: There's a ferry?
Karim: There was until the navy sent it to the bottom of the bay.
Karim: Dozens of people were stranded there, waiting for another one that never
came...
Crane: So there's a settlement there.
Karim: Head east and you'll find it.
Crane: Are there any boats left?
Karim: Yes, but any boat that tries to leave the bay gets blown right out of
the water.

-----
Ferry
-----
Crane: I'm here to make a pick up for Rais.
Morgan: Back already? We just paid off you blood suckers...
Crane: Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just trying to get by like everybody
else.
Morgan: Yeah? So are we. Rais said he'd protect us if we paid him, but so far
all he's done is take our money. There's no "protection". Just threats. You
any different?
Crane: Look, all I want to do is get this over with. What's it going to take?
Do I need to point out how easy it would be to set this entire place on fire?
Morgan: Jesus Christ. You people are f*ck*ng monsters.
Morgan: All my money's in that satchel. Take it, and get the f*ck out.
Crane: For what it's worth... this isn't something I want to do. I'd rather be
helping you guys.
Morgan: And yet you're still doing it, aren't you?
Crane: Okay, Karim, I made the collection at the Ferry Station. And I'm pretty
sure I'm going to Hell.
Karim: Join the club. Now, come back ad claim your prize. Good job today.

Brecken: Crane! Crane, do you copy?
Crane: I copy. What's wrong?
Brecken: Someone's turned on the 18th floor! We're doing our best to contain
the situation, but...
Brecken: I can't sugar-coat this, Crane. We need Antizin right F*CK*NG now.
Crane: Rais has promised me two crates, Brecken. Two crates. I'm doing this
sh*t as fast as I can, I swear.
Brecken: Just... God. Just hurry. Please.
Karim: Crane. How close are you?
Crane: I don't know - about halfway back, I guess.
Karim: Good. I need you to make a quick detour.
Crane: Why?
Karim: One of our patrols went off the grid somewhere near the market.
Crane: How is that my problem?
Karim: I'm making it your problem. See if you can find them or don't bother
coming back.

Crane: Karim, I think I found your lost patrol. Something ripped them limb from
limb.
Karim: Search the bodies. Look for some blueprints in a small envelope.
Karim: And don't damage them! They're worth more than all those dead *ssholes
put together.
Karim: Did you find the envelope?
Crane: Not yet. Wait a sec.
Crane: Holy sh*t!
Crane: Okay. Got it.
Karim: Good. Bring it back to me right away. You're going to be a hero around
here.
Crane: So, I think it's safe to say Rais isn't the most popular person in town,
huh?
Karim: No, but he is the most feared. And you know the old saying? "It is
better to be feared than loved if one cannot be both".
Crane: Machiavelli.
Karim: Correct. Smart fellow, that one.

--------------
Rais' Garrison
--------------
Crane: All right, here are the blueprints.
Karim: Excellent. You're a lot more dependable than most of these drunks. Rais
is waiting for you. Maybe we can work together again sometime.
Crane: God, I hope not.

Rais: If you show them compassion, they will see it as weakness.
Rais: Give them a hand and they will take your whole arm. Understand? I give
you shelter, I give you bread, women, bullets... and you cannot even complete a
simple task.
Rais: I should send every one of you to the pit.
Rais: Ah. The Tower lackey returns. Do you have something for me, "friend"?
Crane: Yes I do.
Crane: Now it's time for you to give me what you promised. Two crates of
Antizin.
Rais: I think not...
Rais: Your loyalty to the Tower is nothing but blind obedience, Crane. A
coward's submission to false hierarchies.
Rais: You follow their rules as thoughtlessly as you follow mine. Like a good
little dog.
Crane: Look, we had a deal!
Rais: Your people need that Antizin. Now more than ever, I would surmise.
Rais: But any man who follows someone else's rules is no man at all. Here... I
will allow you this much.
Crane: You promised me two crates of it. This is only five vials!
Rais: If you want more... I present you with an opportunity.
Rais: The athlete. "The Scorpion". Jade Aldemir. She is one of your number...
Bring her to me.
Rais: I have an arena, where men fight for our amusement. I would have the
Scorpion fight for us. I am curious how long it will take for someone of her
caliber to... break.
Crane: What? ... no. No! Forget it. I'm not doing it.
Rais: I hear no true conviction in your voice, Crane. You have not yet made
your choice, I can tell.
Rais: Will you be a dog and save the dwellers of the Tower? Or will you be a
man, and save the maiden?
Rais: Go. And think about it.

Crane: Crane here.
GRE: Report.
Crane: I'm no longer cooperating with Rais. He wanted me to kidnap Jade Aldemir
and dump her with him, so he can make her fight in his pit.
GRE: Yes? And? Was that it?
Crane: What do you mean, "Was that it?" I'm not a f*ck*ng human trafficker!
GRE: You seem to have forgotten how much is riding on this file, Crane.
GRE: If Rais wants one girl, then give her to him. You'll be there to keep an
eye on her, won't you?
Crane: What the-how can you-what the F*CK kind of humanitarian outfit are you
guys? And for that matter, if this project file can "save the world", why keep
it a f*ck*ng secret?
GRE: We're not paying you to be insubordinate, Crane. GET THIS DONE.
Crane: Oh, f*ck you, *sshole.

The Tower
---------
Jade: Do you have the Antizin? Give it to me.
Crane: So what happened?
Jade: One person turned, and had a couple of other people trapped. We could've
sealed off that one apartment, but Brecken... wanted to save as many lives as
possible...
Jade: It went bad. Somebody had to make the call... Now we've lost the entire
floor. Including... including a couple of kids.
Jade: You'd better talk to Brecken. I have to get these meds to Lena.

Brecken: This is where we get the announcements about the Antizin drops. And
they've just... stopped.
Brecken: There were KIDS in there. I... I froze. Lena had to step up... Maybe
she should be in charge.
Brecken: What the f*ck, Crane, I'm no leader! I'm a g*dd*mn parkour instructor!
Crane: So-all the free running. That was you? Brecken, you showed these people
how to survive.
Brecken: You know what my pockets were full of when I showed up in Harran?
F*ck*ng business cards.
Brecken: I was hoping to drum up some more students. Maybe get enough so I
could save up and buy a house, instead of that poxy little flat I've been
renting.
Brecken: Listen... I'm going to go talk to Rais myself.
Crane: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on a minute. Brecken, these people still need
you. Just give me some time, all right? There's got to be another way. A better
way.
Brecken: ... Fine. I'll wait. But not for long.

Crane: Rahim? Rahim - what're you doing up here?
Rahim: Hey, Crane.
Rahim: Can I trust you?
Crane: How much've you had to drink, kid?
Rahim: Can I or not?
Crane: .. Yeah. What's up?
Rahim: See that skyscraper? The scouts found a volatile nest in there. We take
that out, and then running missions at night? We could totally do that.
Rahim: So I'm thinking, if we planted some explosives...
Crane: Oh, Jesus. (Rahim.) You're not still on that?
Rahim: Crane, we have to do this! As long as that nest is there, we'll never be
able to gather up enough Antizin! It would WORK...
Rahim: We make a good team, raaAHH!
Rahim: Sh*t - sh*t! (Oh my!) Don't drop me don't drop me!
Rahim: Oh f*ck! See? Told ya we make a good team!
Crane: Look, Rahim... we don't have any explosives. None. The closest thing to
what you're talking about are Spike's firecrackers. That's impossible.
Rahim: You don't know what it's like!
Rahim: All I can do is watch. Sit on my ass and watch everything happen and do
nothing.
Rahim: I don't want to die here, Crane. Not like this. Not... helpless. If I
go out, I'd rather go out doing something.
Crane: What's this?
Rahim: I was set to fly out on Sunday. They quarantined us on Thursday. I
already had my bags packed.
Crane: I'll... look, I'll keep my eyes open, okay? If there's some way we could
make this happen...
Rahim: Whatever.

Crane: This is Crane. Do you copy?
GRE: What do you want, Crane?
Crane: I want you to start the Antizin drops again! At least near the Tower.
These people need help.
GRE: We put you in Harran to find our file, not to play Mother Teresa... Or
does this mean you've reconsidered Rais's proposal?
GRE: Perhaps Ms. Aldemir would even be willing to cooperate. Test her skills in
a new environment.
Crane: You start giving us some Antizin, and then... then we'll talk about what
Rais wants.
GRE: Oh, it's "us" now, is it? Well, I'm afraid your request is out of the
question in any case.
GRE: Things have gotten a bit... strained with the Ministry. Resuming the
airdrops would not be politically advantageous at the moment.
Crane: You *ssholes take the f*ck*ng cake, you know that? You and your f*ck*ng
"file".
Crane: I'll locate the file for you. But I'm gonna take a good long look at it
before I decide what to do about it.

Jade: Crane. This is Jade. Do you copy?
Crane: Loud and clear. What can I do for you?
Jade: I don't know how much time we have, so, the short version: I need your
help.
Jade: Rais has turned an abandoned school into a supply dump...
Jade: ... and I think it may be where he's storing his Antizin.
Jade: If you and I sneak in there, we could get all the meds the Tower needs.
Are you with me?
Crane: Yeah. I'm with you.
Jade: Great - meet me in one of the box cars on the train trestle near the
school.
Crane: Okay. And listen, Jade... If we don't find that Antizin, I need to talk
to you about something.
Jade: About what?
Crane: Another option, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right
now let's see what we can find in that school.

++++++++++++++++++
- Siblings [STO-5]
++++++++++++++++++

Jade: (Hey.) Come here. You should see this.
Jade: Something is going on at the school. Tahir's men have been hauling boxes
out of that place for hours. We need to get a closer look.
Crane: What's in the boxes?
Jade: Good question. If it's Antizin, we need it.
Survivor: We're approaching the front gate.
Crane: Jade, where... sh*t.
Crane: F*ck*ng Tahir. That guy should die in a fire. We-
Crane: F*ck, where did she go?
Crane: How many bandits are inside?
Jade: I only saw the ones that went in after Tahir, but I'm sure there's more.
Jade: We should use different entrances - we'll cover more ground, and we'll
make less noise moving separately.

------
School
------
Crane: Okay, Jade, I'm inside.
Jade: Check the classrooms. That's the most likely place for them to store
supplies.
Jade: They should be marked somehow. Military jargon is pretty straight
forward, so it shouldn't be hard to notice.

Loudspeaker: Hurry up! We don't have all day for this sh*t, and this is the
last place I want to be at night!
Loudspeaker: Did any of you idiots think to check the basement? Of course not,
because the key is still up here! Get your sh*t together!
Bandit: Who the f*ck are you? Guys! There's somebody in here!
Jade: Turn that d*mn thing off! We're gonna have walkers swarming towards the
school!

Crane: Jade, no luck with any Antizin. Looks like we'll have to talk about...
that other option. I still have Classroom C to search, though.
Jade: The basement's pretty big. Find the key. I'll meet you down there.
Jade: Give me a hand here, would you?
Crane: Yeah, sure.
Jade: GOD, Crane, you're such an OAF! Why don't you just stick your head out
the door and shout, "Here we are! Come get us!".
Crane: Hey, sometimes there's nothing wrong with the direct... approach.
Jade: Holy sh*t.
Jade: That's... plastic explosives, right?
Crane: Listen. You take this stuff and get back to the Tower. I'll deal with
these *ssholes.
Jade: Don't be ridiculous! We'll fight them together!
Crane: And risk letting them keep this much ordinance? No, just go. I got this.
Meet me back at the Tower.
Jade: Promise me you won't let Rahim near that hive!
Crane: What? Of course! I promise, I promise, just go!

------------------
Outside the school
------------------
Jade: Crane? You've said we needed to talk about other options if we didn't
find any Antizin.
Crane: ... and we will, but right now let's deal with these explosives, ok?
Jade: Okay, listen. I'll give the explosives to Sa'id, and you talk to Rahim.
Make sure he stays away from that hive.
Crane: Will do. Don't worry.
Jade: Don't worry? Right...

---------
The Tower
---------
Rahim: Crane! Sa'id told me about the explosives you guys found! How perfect is
that?!
Rahim: Jade gave them to him - Sa'id used to be on a bomb squad, so he knows
about that stuff.
Crane: Yeah, kid, that was a lucky find. Would've been better to turn up some
Antizin, though.
Rahim: My buddy Omar's making sure Sa'id's putting good timers on those things.
We have to be able to get our asses out of there before they blow.
Crane: Whoa, "we"? There's no "we" in this. I mean, yeah, that nest needs to
go. And now it's possible. But if it gets done, I'm doing it on my own.
Rahim: But... it's my plan!
Crane: And I will execute it perfectly. I promise.
Rahim: But... ah, sh*t. There's no use arguing with you, is there? Fine. I'll
contact you as soon as Sa'id's finished with the charges.
Crane: Rahim, do we have a deal?
Rahim: I guess...
Crane: Do we have a deal?
Rahim: Yes, we have a deal.
Crane: (Okay.) One more thing... I keep seeing this bizarre kind of Infected.
Is Dr. Zere out at his trailer? I'ld like to talk to him about it.
Rahim: Nah, he's down in Sickbay, visiting Dr. Lena.
Crane: Thanks, kid. I'll see you soon.

Crane: Hey, Doc. You got a minute?
Zere: Oh-it's... Kane, yes? How can I help you?
Crane: Crane. Remember when I told you about that weird Infected I saw? You
know, the one who took one look at me and hauled ass away?
Crane: Well, I just saw another one, and it did the same thing.
Zere: Hmmm... I believe I HAVE heard your colleagues talk about those
creatures. "Bolters", they call them.
Zere: Apparently they favor certain areas of town over others, but only appear
at night... I don't suppose you could catch one, and bring me a sample of its
flesh?
Zere: You see, a thought occurred to me - a long shot, I realize - but if these
creatures favor areas where I left my experimental "bait"...
Zere: Well. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Please do obtain a sample. But it
has to be fresh, so you have to get it back to me quickly.
Crane: OK. And where exactly do I find these things?
Zere: I'm told that quartermaster chap has been keeping track of them.

Quartermaster: What can I do for you?
Crane: Doc Zere says you know where I should look for these, uh, "bolters"...
Crane: Super-fast Infected? Covered in big green blisters?
Quartermaster: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can point you in the right direction.
Quartermaster: Here, here, and here. Though, you ask me, if trouble don't come
lookin' for you, no reason to go lookin' for trouble.
Crane: Words to live by. Thanks.

Bolter hunting
--------------
Spike: Crane, you there?
Crane: (Hey!) What's up, Spike?
Spike: Just FYI... if you need me, I'll be at the ferry station, helping Morgan
prep the barge.
Spike: Strangest thing, he said he got shaken down by some young man who
sounded an awful lot like you.
Spike: You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Crane: Hey, I've gotta run! I'll talk to you later, Spike!

Crane: Okay, Doc... here comes your chunk of zombie guts.
Zere: Ah, Crane! Come in, come in! Did you get the samples I asked for?
Zere: Excellent, excellent! I was just telling Dr. Camden about you.
Camden: Hello, Mr. Crane. Glad to have you working with us. You sound like an
impressive individual.
Zere: Interesting stuff, what passes for blood in this creature.
Photosensitive. Quite deadly if used on a weapon, I'd wager. But I digress!
Zere: My last bit of reagent here... and a reserve vial of...
Zere: Oh my word! This tissue! It's testing positive for the recombined virus!
Camden! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
Camden: The meat experiment worked!
Zere: When I dosed the meat samples with the altered strain? It's HAD AN
EFFECT! This could explain all the different mutations!
Zere: But I can't. Camden could... he has the equipment... but we have no way
to get the research to him.
Crane: You can talk to him on the radio. Why not share info that way?
Camden: There's too much data, Crane. It would take years. We'd both be dead
and gone before he finished.
Zere: "Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink."
Crane: What if I delivered this stuff to you, Dr. Camden? By hand? The data and
the tissue samples both?
Camden: Crane... getting from there to here would be insanely dangerous.
Crane: But it could mean a cure, right?
Zere: You don't know how much this means, dear boy! To me, to all of us!
Zere: I'll contact you when everything's ready! You must go now! Much to do!
Much to do!

--------------
Rahim and Omar
--------------
Rahim: Hey. Crane. You there? Omar and I went to blow up that nest.
Crane: (Wait.) You what?! F*ck*ng hell, Rahim, that was MY job!
Rahim: Oh, right, 'cause you're more qualified to handle explosives than I am!
You're just a godd*mn tourist! But listen - we messed up.
Rahim: Messed up bad.
Crane: What happened? Where are you?
Rahim: On the overpass and it's all going to sh*t...
Crane: Head to the trainyard! Find a place to hide! I'm on my way!
Rahim: Omar! Behind you! BEHIND YOU!
Crane: Rahim? Rahim! Godd*mn it!
Crane: Brecken! Brecken, do you copy?
Brecken: Yeah, I copy. What is it?
Crane: I'm on my way to get Rahim.
Brecken: Rahim? He's here in the Tower.
Crane: No, he's not. He and Omar went to blow that nest, and now they're in
trouble.
Brecken: THEY WHAT?! F*ck! Where'd they get the explosives?
Crane: I... look, I stole them from Rais.
Brecken: Oh, Jesus H. CHRIST.
Crane: I'm close. I'll get him to safety, Brecken.
Brecken: You d*mn well better. You save him, you hear me? You save him, so I
can kick his f*ck*ng ass... Does Jade know about this?
Crane: No, she doesn't.
Brecken: Well for God's sake, don't tell her. She'll go out looking for him and
I don't need her getting herself killed too. GODD*MN IT! -

Crane: Rahim... where the hell are you?
Crane: Brecken! It's me. I found Omar's body on the overpass. No trace of
Rahim.
Brecken: Sh*t... Any idea where he'd go?
Rahim: I told him to hide in the train yard.
Brecken: You find him! You hear me? That little b*st*rd better be alive...

Rahim: THAT'S RIGHT! KEEP COMING, YOU MOTHERF*CK*RS! I'LL SEND YOU ALL TO HELL!
Crane: Rahim!
Rahim: Crane! I didn't think I'd make it, so I armed the bombs! They'll blow in
less than five minutes!
Crane: Sh*t - kid, you're bleeding!
Rahim: Huh? Oh - I cut myself. It's nothing. F*ck, just plant the bombs!
Crane: (Alright.) Don't move! Got it? I'll be right back!
Crane: Rahim, can you hear me? Where the f*ck am I going with these things?
Rahim: There's a sewer entrance here in the terminal, near the west wall! Use
that tunnel - it'll take you straight to the hive!

Crane: Okay, I'm back on the surface.
Rahim: See that big-ass culvert over to your right? Head through it!
Rahim: Once you get into the building, head up the ramp and get up to the floor
above! You need to put the bomb on one of the big support columns!
Crane: Okay, first one's set!
Rahim: Okay, pay attention! Find some stairs and get to the next floor up!
Rahim: You're looking for another column like the first one!
Crane: All right, got it!

Crane: Rahim, it worked man! Your plan worked, kid! ... Rahim? Hey, do you
copy? ... Sh*t.
Crane: Rahim, it's me! I did it!
Crane: Rahim! You should have seen it!
Crane: The whole d*mn building came down!
Crane: SH*T!
Crane: No no no - Rahim, stop!
Crane: Rahim, it's me! It's me, buddy! It's Crane! Oh Jesus... Rahim, stop!
Crane: That's a f*ck*ng bite wound...
Crane: You GODd*mn STUPID f*ck*ng KID!
Crane: Oh God... Jade...
Brecken: Crane! Do you copy? What's going on?
Crane: Brecken... Rahim... Rahim's dead.
Brecken: F*ck! ... Get back here. And don't say a word to Jade. Not yet.

The Tower
---------
Crane: Brecken?
Brecken: How did he die?
Crane: I... I had to kill him.
Crane: It was too late. He turned. I had no choice, I swear.
Crane: Look, he was my friend too. He was the best one I had here.
Brecken: I know. I know... He frustrated the sh*t out of me sometimes, but I
loved him like he was my own kin.
Brecken: Another dead friend. Another dead brother...
Crane: I trusted him. I trusted him with those explosives... God, maybe if I
didn't leave him there... he would still be alive.
Crane: Oh, no... Jade-
Brecken: Jade. Wait!
Crane: Jade - God D*MN it!
Brecken: Just - just give her time. She needs to grieve.
Brecken: Zere! SH*T!
Brecken: Get down there! We can't let them take him!

Survivor: This is an emergency!!! Au secours!
Survivor: Hey! Anyone?! I could really use some help!
Survivor: Can anyone hear me!!!??? Help!
Maalik: There's no one inside. They took Zere and drove away.
Crane: Sh*t... !
Crane: Brecken, Zere's been kidnapped. His trailer's on fire.
Brecken: God d*mn it! You see what happens when you f*ck with Rais? You should
never have hit that school!
Brecken: Some of our people spotted a big knot of bandits heading back to
Rais's Garrison. That's got to be where they took Zere.
Brecken: You go there and you find him and you bring him back alive. You hear
me?

Brecken: Crane - look, I know I've been hard on you. But after what happened to
Rahim... and now Dr. Zere, you have to understand...
Crane: Brecken, there's no apologies necessary. And don't worry, I'll bring
Zere back in one piece.
Brecken: Just be careful, okay? And I'm sorry about Rahim. I know you were
close. Hell, I loved that stupid kid too.

--------------
Rais' Garrison
--------------
Crane: Brecken? The Garrison's shut down... The doors are sealed off... I don't
think I can get in.
Brecken: Find another way in, then. Check the back. But don't take any stupid
chances.
Brecken: Those b*st*rds'll rip you apart if they get the opportunity.
Crane: Okay - found an entrance. Can't say it was easy, though. I'm going in.
Brecken: Just keep your eyes open. Good luck in there.

Crane: Crane here. I could REALLY use some GRE support right now.
GRE: That's too bad, Agent Crane. This is the Ministry of Defense.
Crane: The f*ck- What the hell is going on? What happened to the GRE?
GRE: The Global Relief Effort's position here has been... diminished.
GRE: We are in charge now, and we have declared Harran a Code One Target Zone.
Crane: Wait, wait, wait... just hang on! You can't just carpet-bomb this place!
There are still hundreds of innocent people in here! Maybe thousands!
GRE: Irrelevant. We're doing this to protect BILLIONS of lives. Surely you can
understand that.
Crane: Okay, okay - just listen! There's this scientist in here named Zere, and
he's been doing research on a cure! And he's really close! I've seen the
research! If you bomb the city...
GRE: ... Acknowledged. The chances of one scientist in a wrecked city coming up
with useful results are negligible at best, but... you have 48 hours.

Zere: Who is it? Who's there?
Crane: Relax, Doc. It's me.
Zere: Crane! Thank God! Listen, this is important! I'm not safe anymore-
obviously-but my research must not die with me!
Crane: You're not gonna die, Doc! But right now we have to get out of here, so
please, lower your voice.
Zere: Oh! Oh. Yes. All right. But understand-my research. It must reach Dr.
Camden! That's why I gave the packages to Jade.
Zere: I know you said you would deliver them, but she was there, and time being
of the essence-
Crane: Doc?
Rais: So. It takes no more than the false hope of rescue to loosen the good
doctor's lips.
Rais: Hunt the Scorpion down. Spare no resource.
Tahir: With pleasure. And these two? What should we do with them?
Zere: You'll never find her! Never! And I'll never talk! You'll get nothing
from me!
Rais: I am less concerned with making you talk now, Doctor, than I am in
preventing your escape.
Crane: You sadistic f*ck! He's an old man!
Rais: Give the doctor some first aid.
Rais: And take Crane to the pit.

The Pit

Rais: Stand him up.
Crane: Oh sh*t... Doc!
Rais: You come to us like a snake in the grass. Here, in a city of lies, you
are the biggest liar of all.
Crane: What're you talking about? ... Answer me, motherf*ck*r!
Rais: Yes, lose control. That is what you Americans are so good at, after all.
If I-
Rais: Not bad.
Rais: Clear out the corpses. Leave Crane.
Rais' soldier: Yes sir!

Rais: Word of your feats here will spread. Such a shame you'll be a corpse by
then.
Rais: Is this your first feeble attempt at controlling your own destiny, Crane?
Too little, too late, I fear.
Rais: Impressive. For a walking dead man.

Rais: You have provided some quality entertainment for my men. Too bad it's a
one-time performance.
Rais: This will only prolong the inevitable. But try to make the best of it.
Rais: Let no one say I never gave you anything, Crane.
Rais: Your skills no longer come as a surprise, Crane. The GRE selects its
operatives well.
Crane: Oooohh sh*t.
Rais: Lower the platform!
Rais: Drop the weapon.
Rais: Chaos, Crane. Chaos is the one true order of things. To pretend otherwise
is the sheerest folly. Allow me to demonstrate.
Rais: Basaam. Can you hear me?
Basaam: Loud and clear.
Rais: Publish the file.
Basaam: Right away, sir... Annnd... there. It is sent.
Crane: You maniac! You've just doomed thousands of innocent people! That's what
you get with your f*ck*ng chaos!
Rais: You don't know what was in that file, do you, Crane? You only prove my
point for me. The GRE plans to weaponize the virus, not cure it.
Rais: They're only interested in profit. Not saving lives... and by following
their rules, you have become their trained monkey... Pathetic!
Rais: All right. Kill him.
Crane: Doc - come on, let's get you out of here.
Zere: Crane. Save these people... They don't deserve all this.
(Rais: You! Give me the torch!)
Rais: ... CRANE!
Rais: What are you swine waiting for? SHOOT HIM!
Crane: I'm sorry, Doc!
Crane: Run...
Crane: Sh*t! Almost got me...

(Crane: No. Not again!)
Crane: Zere... Zere's dead.

Crane: Sh*t!
Brecken: You alright?
Crane: Where am I?
Brecken: I had to hide you at the pier. Half of Rais's men are after you.
Whatever you've done, it's really put them on the warpath.
Crane: I have to talk to Jade. Zere gave her his research...
Brecken: She took it to Camden-or she tried to.
Brecken: Camden radioed that Rais's thugs had found his lab, so he flooded it
with biters and barricaded himself in the middle. Now, he's trapped.
Brecken: Then the connection failed. We haven't been able to raise him since.
Crane: I'm going after her. How was she getting in? That part of town is sealed
off.
Brecken: There's a group called "The Saviors" that smuggles people through.
Brecken: They have a den at Nico's Bar in the cauldron, near the highway. The
contact's name is Cenk.
Crane: Do you have enough runners to cover air drops?
Brecken: The air drops stopped 36 hours ago. There won't be any more. We're out
of time, Crane.
Crane: Sh*t... all right. I don't know if I can fix this, but I'm sure as hell
going to try.
Brecken: You know, most men in your situation would crawl in a hole and hide.
Hats off to you, mate. And good luck.
Timur: (Hey.) Crane? Here's your gear, take it. Best regards from Karim.
Crane: (Karim, huh?) Uh... (if you see him,) thank him for me.

Brecken: Crane? One more thing, mate. Do you remember that girl from Sector 0?
Troy...
Crane: Yeah... she called me to thank me after I get the antenna towers
working.
Brecken: You should contact her when you get there.
Crane: Yes, that's a good idea. Thanks, Brecken.
Brecken: Right... you take care!

At the cauldron

Cenk: What do you want?
Crane: I'm looking for the Saviors.
Cenk: Don't know what you're talking about.
Crane: I'm one of Brecken's men. From the Tower.
Cenk: I don't care where you're from. Get your ass outta here, or I will stop
being so f*ck*ng polite.
Crane: Listen, I know you're smuggling people out of the Slums. There's a girl
who came through. Jade?
Cenk: I think you better get the hell out of here.
Crane: (No.) Just listen! I cut Rais up, and now his whole godd*mn gang is
after me. I could use some cooperation here.
Cenk: You? You're the one who chopped Rais's hand off?
Crane: Yeah. And now I have to get to Sector 0!
Cenk: What's your name?
Crane: Crane.
Cenk: Well, Crane, you're in for some heartbreak if you think going to Sector 0
will get you off Rais's sh*t list. But... wait here.
Cenk: I got a guy here who claims he's the one who took Rais's hand off...
Crane... ... Yeah, that's what he said... Really? Are you sure? ... huh, ok...
right.
Cenk: Come here.
Cenk: Okay. We'll get you to the other side.
Crane: All right, when?
Cenk: Right now.
Crane: What about payment?
Cenk: What you did to Rais - that's more than enough payment for us. Go to the
collapsed tunnel that led to Old Town.
Cenk: Knock at the door that leads to the sewers. Someone will take good care
of you.
Crane: Will do. Thanks.
Cenk: Nah, man. Thank YOU.

Hazan: Who?
Crane: She's from here. Dark hair. Pretty. Tough as nails.
Hazan: (Uhh.) Maybe. Don't know. We don't always ask names.
Hazan: Okay, from here on out, you're on your own. The route is marked. I'll

Smuggler: I don't make the rules. Wait here!

Hazan: We try to keep the route clear, but there may be some Infected here and
there. Shouldn't be a problem for you, though.
Hazan: Hey, friend. Sorry, but I had no choice. Rais has me by the balls.
Crane: What?! Hey! What did you do?!
Hazan: What I had to... What can I say? The world is an unforgiving place...
Crane: F*ck*ng sellouts.

Bandit: Sh*t, where are they? How long are we supposed to wait for them?
(Bandit: There he is!)
Crane: Brecken, do you copy? Crane here.
Brecken: What's going on, mate?
Crane: Tell everyone to stay away from the Saviors. They sold me out to Rais.
I barely made it out alive.
Brecken: Sh*t. I hope you're okay. Be sure to contact Troy, when you get to
Sector 0. She's the only friendly face you have over there.
Crane: Got it! Will do! Keep your fingers crossed for me.

Troy: Crane? It's great to hear from you! What can I help you with?
Crane: (Yeah.) I'm in your neck of the woods now, and I'd love to put our heads
together. Where can I find you?
Troy: You're here? In the Zero? Fantastic! Have you seen a pair of towers, one
taller than the other, with scaffolding around them?
Troy: We call that our "loft". Head that way. We'll be waiting.

to get here, it won't be easy getting in.
Camden: I had to barricade myself inside because of Rais and his thugs.
Crane: You okay?
Camden: I'm trapped inside my lab but safe. Are you coming my way?

Savvy: Come on, say hello to Troy!
Crane: I'm Kyle Crane. It's good to finally put a face with the voice.
Troy: You're looking for Jade Aldemir, aren't you?
Crane: Yeah, yeah... have you seen her? Do you know where she is?
Troy: Jade? This is Troy. Do you copy?
Jade: Go ahead, Troy.
Crane: Jade! It's Crane! Listen, I know you're headed for Dr. Camden, but his
clinic's surrounded by zombies and Rais's thugs. Let me come and help you.
Jade: Crane... stay away from me. I hear your voice, and all I can see is my
brother.
Crane: Please, just hear me out. The thing is... the GRE hired me. (Alright?)
Jade: I was supposed to find out where Rais sent this classified file, but that
doesn't matter anymore, because the Ministry contacted me.
Crane: (Jade.) They were going to firebomb the city, but I talked them into
waiting...
Crane: ...because they want that research that you're carrying. We need to
figure out some way to let them know that we've got it.
Jade: You b*st*rd. YOU B*ST*RD.
Crane: Jade... ? Jade! ... D*MN it.
Troy: Crane... the last time I spoke to her, she was at the University. It's
due east from here. If what you just said is even a little bit true, you have
to find her.

Troy: Savvy has an idea of how to break through the radio jamming and contact

Troy: He'll be working on that while you're busy looking for Jade.
Crane: That's fantastic! Let's hope he's on to something.
Troy: I'll be in touch.

They've always been dangerous, but now they're mutating into something even

Crane: Hey, buddy, have you seen a woman named Jade Aldemir? She's got long
dark hair, she's tough as nails?
Guard: Yeah, she was walking to what's-his-name over there.
Crane: Thanks.
Crane: Jade? JADE! Are you here?
Fidan: Wh-who are you? What do you want?
Crane: No sign of Jade... dammit.
Crane: Hey - can you help me? I'm looking for a young woman. Dark hair, petite,
takes no sh*t from anyone? Her name's Jade Aldemir.
Fidan: Yes, she was here. You didn't miss her by too much. She waited around
for a while with a big scowl on her face, and then took off.
Crane: God D*MN it. Did she say where she was going?
Fidan: No. But you're Crane, right? She left this for you.
Crane: That's Amir. Why would she have left me this... ?
Fidan: Well, I can't say for certain, but she did ask me to tell you, "Not
again". Don't know what that's supposed to mean.

Crane: Looks pretty comfortable.
Spike: Crane! Good to see you again!
Crane: Spike?! Holy sh*t! How'd you get here?
Spike: Wasn't easy. Anyway, Brecken sends his best.
Spike: And listen, from now on you can always find me here, okay? Everything I
had for you in the Slums, that'll all be here too, so feel free to use it.
Crane: Yeah. Thanks, Spike.
Spike: No problem, buddy. See you next time.

Crane: Jade, this is Crane. Do you copy? ... Jade, can you hear me? ...
Nothing.
Crane: Troy, this is Crane. Do you copy?
Troy: Crane! I was just about to contact you! Savvy broke through the jamming
and... I think you'd better get back here. You have to see this.
Crane: Why... ? What do I have to see?
Troy: You have to see it for yourself. Just... get back here, all right? I'm
serious!

Troy: No matter how many times I watch it, I still can't believe it.
Reporter: An internal Global Relief Effort document surfaced today that, if
verified, implicates the GRE in a far-reaching criminal conspiracy.
Reporter: Instead of trying to find a cure for the Harran Virus, according to
the file, the GRE had plans to weaponize it and sell it to the highest bidder.
World-wide backlash has-
Troy: No, no, skip to the important bit.
Survivor: I was the last survivor left in the quarantine. I can't believe I
made it out.
Survivor: I can't believe I'm stil alive...
Reporter: We mourn all those who didn't survive, but as the President said in a
speech here earlier today, life is for the living.
Reporter: Military troops have searched for survivors all over the quarantine,
but now there's no one left besides the Infected.
Reporter: According to Colonel Taner, once his decontamination process is
finished, the infection will be completely obliterated.
Crane: The Ministry did this. They're making their excuses to the rest of the
world for destroying a city.
Troy: Look, Crane, before you go charging out of here-we already had an idea of
how to send a message.
Troy: We were going to plant explosives in a building and set off fires in a
pattern-something the zombies could never do.
Troy: Trouble is, we got a runner, Michael, over to the right building, but he
can't get through to the top floors. Too many biters.
Troy: As much as I hate to admit it, none of the rest of us are strong enough
to do this job...
Crane: Well, we've got to do something RIGHT F*CK*NG NOW, or you, me, Jade,
and everybody else are going to get blown to bits.
Crane: Tell Michael I'm on my way... and while I'm doing that, can you get in

see me jump like that. She'd NEVER take me seriously.
Crane: Got a little crush, huh?
Michael: How could I not? Have you met her? That's why I volunteered for this!
Crane: You're... risking your life with a horde of flesh-eating zombies to
impress a girl?
Michael: Mate, before the outbreak, the most impressive thing I'd ever done was
win a spelling bee.
Michael: Okay? Troy would've never even looked at me. So I'll take my
opportunities where I can.
Crane: Fair enough. Tell me what needs to happen here.
Michael: Well, okay, I tried to finish the job, but I couldn't get past the
ninth floor.
Crane: Leave it to me.
Michael: What needs to happen is, you take these explosives, turn on the gas
ovens, and plant charges in a few specific apartments.
Crane: And that'll make a pattern, huh? One nobody outside Harran could mistake
as random?
Michael: If they can explain this sh*t away, we're all gonna be really f*ck*n'
impressed.

Crane: Those sons of B*TCH*S.
Jade: F*ck. Crane, if you're really on our side, you've got to contact the GRE.
They must stop the Ministry from bombing the city!
Crane: I know, but I lost my one and only way to reach them...
Troy: Guys! Listen... Savvy's figured out a way to break through the jamming!
He just needs your help to do it!
Crane: Okay! Jade, you heard that? We have to meet.
Jade: Yeah... all right. Meet me in that red building on Emerald Canal. We'll
go from there.

somewhere. Do you know what he's talking about?
Troy: Museum? Yes... Rais is using it as his headquarters. Crane... you can't
go there. That place was built as a fortress... you'd be walking into a massive
trap!
Crane: (No, no, no.) It's not subtle enough to be a trap. But there's got to be
a way to sneak in, right? (I mean.) Some way to surprise them?
Troy: Let me think... uh... Tariq maybe?
Troy: He's the museum's curator. He should know something about the dungeons
hidden beneath the fortress.
Crane: Good, I'll talk to him.
Troy: All right. There's a building with a rooftop garden. You'll find Tariq
there.
Troy: And listen-if you get the chance, find yourself some new weapons. You'll
need them.

got nobody to look out for him, but I'm not so good with kids, y'know?
Crane: That's not why I'm here.
Tariq: But... Troy promised she'd send someone.
Crane: I need to get into the museum.
Tariq: The museum? ... But Troy told me someone would come to help. She
promised...
Crane: Okay, Tariq. You tell me how to get into the museum, and maybe I can
sort out your problem here, okay?
Tariq: Rais controls the museum. He would kill you on sight.
Crane: Well, then I can't have him see me. Now, Troy said you used to be the
curator, and that if anybody would know a way in, it would be you. So, how do
I do it?
Tariq: Do you have a scuba gear, perhaps?
Crane: No.
Tariq: Too bad. There's an entrance under the surface of Emerald Pond, but it
would be a long swim under the water. You would most likely drown.
Crane: Well, most likely isn't definitely, so I guess I'll give it a try.

took something of yours.
Crane: I don't negotiate with *ssholes, Rais. I get out of here with Jade or I
take your other hand too. Your choice.
Rais: You cannot simply DEMAND to have her, Crane. You must make a showing of
EFFORT first.
Tahir: ATTACK!

Rais: Crane, Crane, Crane... Jade's dying to see you.

much left of her...

Jade's demise
-------------
Crane: JADE! Oh sh*t... oh sh*t, what have they done to you...
Jade: I'm... fine, Crane. Tahir knocked me over the head before he dumped me in
here. Just... give me a minute, I'll be right as rain.
Rais: You do not have the luxury of a minute, "Scorpion".
Rais: In fact, what little time you have, you owe to me. Thanks to your repair
of my antennas, Crane, I have listened to every word any of you have said.
Rais: How do you suppose I found you, Ms. Aldemir? Or the good Dr. Camden? How
do you think I broke the connection between the sectors?
Rais: I am the director of this film. And now that I have Zere's research...
the GRE will do as I COMMAND them.
Rais: Which renders the two of you useless. Tahir!
Rais: You took offense, Crane, as I recall, at being referred to as a trained
monkey.
Rais: But look at you now. Dancing. For our amusement.
Rais: You are strong enough to have joined me. But you lack the proper...
character.
Rais: Consider this a character-strengthening exercise.
Crane: Come on, Jade! Let's get out of here!

Crane: Oh, Jade, are... Jade! Are you hurt? They didn't bite you, did they?
Jade: I'm fine! I'm fine. Just... give me a second.
Rais: Sweet little Jade is far from "fine", Crane. She was bitten and infected
hours ago. How noble of her to try and hide it from you.
Jade: Biter got me on the leg. You didn't need to know.
Rais: Once again you find yourself with a choice, Crane.
Rais: Your precious Scorpion is about to turn... but so are you.
Rais: Who will receive the Antizin? Who has a hope of living through this
encounter? It's up to you now.
Crane: Jade... here, you take this.
Jade: No.
Crane: No, come on! Listen! I've still got some in my system - you need this
worse than I do!
Jade: Crane... I just want you to promise me one thing.
Jade: When the time comes, you're the one who takes me out.
Crane: What?! No... I...
Jade: PROMISE ME!
Crane: (What?) Jade. I can't-

Jade: Crane! Crane, can you hear me?
Crane: Jade, where are you?
Crane: Jade!
Jade: I need you to hear me, Crane!
Jade: I know you wanted to try and save me. Not everybody would've offered that
vial the way you did.
Jade: But it's too late for that now. It's too late for me.
Jade: For a while I blamed you for Amir's death, I wanted to kill you.
Jade: But I realized... it was time for Amir. It was time for him to go.
(Boy: Zombie! Run!)
Jade: Everybody's life is finite, Crane. You can't deny it. It's pointless.
Jade: We get here, and eventually we die, and there's nothing we can do to
change that.
(Crane: Sh*t! My hand!)
(Brecken: There were kids in there!)
(Crane: No! Not again!)
Jade: The only thing we can do is make what happens in between COUNT.
(Zere: Crane. Save these people...)
Jade: Amir's life counted. And now he's gone. Rahim's life counted. And now
HE'S gone.
Jade: If sacrificing my life means saving everyone in Harran... then that's
what I want to do.
(Crane: Sh*t! My hand!)
Jade: Don't take that away from me, Crane.
Jade: I was born premature. The doctors didn't think I was going to live.
Jade: But I fought. I struggled, and I fought, and I worked, and worked, and
worked.
Jade: I became a champion. I became the Scorpion. I left my mark on the world.
Jade: It's my time now, Crane. You can't save me. You've got to let me save
you. Let me save you.
(Amir: GET THE DOOR OPEN!)
Crane: No... God d*mn it, NO... don't make me do this!
Crane: Oh no-oh God, Jade, what was I... I'm so sorry, I-I didn't mean to...
Jade: One of us has to live, Kyle... You just remember what you promised me.
Rais: All of this, and still you had your choice made for you. Disappointing,
Crane.
Rais: You, you, you and you. Get in there and kill them.
Rais: THAT is the natural order of things, Crane. Kill or be killed. Eat or be
eaten.
Crane: Goodbye, Jade.

Tahir: When he wants you, he will find you himself!
Tahir: I can see this kind of talk pains you. Don't worry! The pain will soon
be over!
Tahir: Time to die, boy!

Crane: Look at that. Jade lost her life for this thing, it's just lying on the
floor.
Crane: I guess Rais must've dropped it when he was trying not to get shot, huh?
Crane: Sh*t... this is just the tissue samples. Where's the other package?
Tahir: Go to... hell... Crane.
Crane: Wow, Tahir. You're looking pretty f*ck*d up, huh? Yeah, those don't look
like the kinds of wounds you recover from.
Tahir: So? Then... kill me.
Crane: No, no... I shouldn't. I should just leave you here to suffer. That's
what you deserve.
Tahir: Yes? ... Then why don't you?
Crane: Because you're not the kind of loose end you leave untied.

Crane: Rais... he... he forced us to...
Crane: Jade saved my life, Troy. Again. She died... saving me.
Troy: Crane... you've still got to call off the Ministry. That's why Jade
sacrificed herself. So you could do this.
Troy: So you could save the rest of us.
Crane: Is Savvy there? Has he figured out how to get a message through?
Troy: Yes, but to do it you need to meet me.
Troy: I have to give you an amplifier, that Savvy says can help us break

at the edge of town?
Troy: The fastest way is through the sewers. Savvy'll guide you over the radio,
so contact him when you get to the other side.

Crane: F*ck! No no NO!
Crane: Yeah, nothing can go wrong with this plan...

Old Town

Crane: Dr. Camden? This is Kyle Crane. Can you hear me?
Camden: I can hear you. Are you on your way? I'm ready to work, just bring me
the samples.
Crane: That's exactly what I intend to do, Doc.
Camden: Just remember... I'm surrounded by an army of infected.
Crane: Affirmative. Expect me soon.
Camden: Good. Not like I'm going anywhere.

- The Clinic [STO-14]
+++++++++++++++++++++

Camden: You must be Crane. I can see you through the security cameras.
Crane: That's me. Name's Crane.
Camden: Use the elevator. Push the button for the bottom floor.
Crane: Got it.

------------
Camden's lab
------------
Camden: I was sad to hear about Dr. Zere. He and I were thrilled to get the
chance to study the Harran Virus...
Camden: Not to mention, the GRE paid us quite handsomely.
Camden: (Oh.) By the way, we're on backup power now, so we have minimal
functionality.
Camden: I needed extra power for my last experiment and the generators
overheated and shut down.
Camden: I hope you don't mind me reminiscing out loud like this.
Camden: It's been quite a number of weeks since I've had the prospect of
talking to an actual live human, in person.
Camden: Oh - and the door leading to the main corridor can only be opened
manually.
Camden: You'll have to get to the security room and throw the switch.
Crane: On my way.
Camden: All right, now go down the main corridor. The lab is on the left.
Camden: When the outbreak happened, Zere and I stayed in the quarantine to work
on the cure.
Camden: You know who was supposed to protect us? Kadir Suleiman! Rais himself!
Camden: THAT worked out just perfectly.
Camden: Okay. The only way into the lab is through the decontamination room.
The entrance is to the right.
Camden: Everything went straight to hell after Rais's brother died, you know.
Camden: Rais went from a guy with monstrous tendencies to a full-blown monster.
Camden: You'll have to run the decontamination protocol to unlock the doors.
Camden: It won't work without full power, though. That's where the generators
come in.
Camden: Head to the offices. Once you're there, I'll point you in the right
direction.
Crane: All right, I'm on it...
Camden: Zere and I got to safety with the help of a GRE operative - a man very
similar to you...
Camden: The operative who helped us was supposed to evacuate alongside us...
but you can guess how well that worked out, since Zere and I both got stuck
here.
Camden: Be extra careful, now - I never cleared the Infected from that part of
the facility, as I've never had a reason to go in there.
Camden: I got separated from the two of them, but I made it here, to this
clinic. I really had no other option than to work on finding a cure.
Camden: Watch it - I'm opening the door.
Camden: Zere and the operative fell in with Brecken's crowd. I guess I would
have as well, if I'd been able to get to them.
Camden: Hmm... I'm sorry about this, but the only way to get to the generator
room is through the ventilation shafts.
Camden: The shafts lead to the stockroom. From there you can reach the hallway
and then the generators.
Crane: Man, I hope two is enough...
Camden: Good job. Now head back to the decontamination room.
Camden: You know, I suspect, even if Zere had been able to leave the
quarantine, he wouldn't have.
Camden: He and the operative both felt the need to stay and help people.
Camden: Push the button by the door to begin the process.
Camden: All right. Now you can come in.

Camden: Crane, glad to be finally shaking hands with you. Now, let's have those
tissue samples, shall we?
Crane: Doc... mind if I show you a photo?
Camden: No, no, no... just, just, just... one minute.
Camden: All right. We'll just let that run. That's gonna take quite a while.
Now, what was it you wanted to say?
Camden: Hey! That's him! That's the GRE operative I was telling you about!
What's his name?
Crane: Amir.
Camden: Yes! YES! Amir Ghoreyshi! ... What are you doing with a picture of him?
Crane: We, uh... had a mutual friend.
Camden: The samples are still viable. That's good. With some luck, your trip
here won't have been for nothing.
Camden: Where is the rest of the data, by the way? I know Zere prepared two
packages.
Crane: I'll have to get back to you on that, Doc. Right now I have some GRE
sh*theads to confront.
Camden: GRE? ... Crane, you watch yourself around them. Their public face is a
lie of epic proportions. Those people are all heartless, lying b*st*rds.
Crane: I hear you, Doc. And thanks, I'll be in touch.

--------
Old Town
--------
Camden: Listen, Crane, I've got to reiterate: you'd better watch your back,
your front, and both sides with those GRE b*st*rds. They'll screw you if they
get the chance.
Crane: I know, Doc. I'll be careful. I just need to figure out where things
stand.

Crane: Troy? I gave the samples to Dr. Camden. Now I'm gonna have a little talk
with the GRE.
Troy: And what are you going to tell them?
Crane: Everything... I'll meet you later, Troy.
Crane: This is Crane. Do you copy?
Rais: Kyle Crane. You can hear me, can you not?
Crane: Rais! Where are you?
Rais: Exactly where I should be - atop my own Tower. Of course, mine is not
quite complete...
Rais: ...but it still stands as a monument to chaos... to entropy. To what it
means to be ruled only by oneself.
Crane: I'll kill you. For what you did to Jade... for EVERYTHING. I'll f*ck*ng
KILL YOU.
Rais: I had hoped that would be your attitude. You see, we are at war, you and
I.
Rais: A war of opposing philosophies. A war to see whose vision of the world
proves true.
Rais: Come, Crane. Come and challenge me. What is it you Americans are so fond
of saying... ? "I dare you."
Crane: You know what? ... Forget it. There's no "war". There's only your
f*ck*d-up outlook. Go to hell.
Rais: Oh, no, I won't be going to hell. I will be leaving Harran, though.
Rais: You see, I have made a deal with our GRE brothers. Using your very own
communicator, no less.
Rais: They know I have all of Dr. Zere's research data.
Rais: They called it "the keys to the kingdom". Very shortly a helicopter will
come and take me away.
Rais: Imagine the damage I shall be able to do, outside the confines of these
walls! Of course, if you think you can stop me...
Crane: You crazy son of a B*TCH.
Rais: THAT is what I had hoped to hear. Come and find me, Crane. Let us finish
what we began.

+++++++++++++++++++++
- Extraction [STO-15]
+++++++++++++++++++++

Crane: Oh sh*t... what the hell... ?
Rais: I knew you could not resist, Crane.
Crane: Would you just shut up? You're the last thing I want to hear.
Rais: What? HEAR me? What a brilliant idea!
Rais: There... much better. It is fitting than an orchestra plays when kings
clash.
Rais: THERE... the agents of my will!
Rais: Run, Crane, run. It's what you slaves are good at, right? Run or die!
Rais: Quite an entrance. Perhaps you ARE a king... a king of MUD.
Rais: Here, Crane...
Rais: ... accept an offering to the king!
Rais: You cannot kill me. You cannot defeat me.
Rais: You cannot even REACH me.
Rais: And yet you try and try. Let me offer you a bit of accompaniment.
Rais: The music of SUFFERING. Played by slaves... perfect for a slave!
Rais: Come on, come on... faster, goddammit...
Karim: Crane. Rais said you would come...
Crane: You've been shot! What the f*ck is going on?
Karim: This is... what we get for... trying to make a living.
Karim: Rais... betrayed us all.
Crane: Yeah, I'm on my way up there, Karim. I'm going to kill that motherf*ck*r
with my bare hands.
Karim: Not... this way. We've laid mines on the... two floors above us... Go
through the second block... As high as you can... Then... you can come back...
Crane: Goodbye, Karim.
Crane: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Rais: Hmmm. Karim managed to warn you, did he not? I was right to shoot him.
Rais: Some might think it unsporting of me, taking aim at you like this.
Crane: I liked you better when you didn't talk so d*mn much...
Rais: But I consider it a matter of... let us call it "leveling the playing
field". That is a term you can understand, yes?
Rais: You sound as if that hurt, Crane.
Rais: Allow me to add to your suffering!
Rais: I cast the deciding vote, Crane.
Rais: Consider yourself expelled!
Rais: Do you know how many men have bested me in a fight before, Crane?
Rais: None. No one. NEVER.
Rais: Consider yourself a member of an exclusive club.
Crane: Where are you hiding, you f*ck*r!?
Rais: Sad for you, it is a club I mean to disband.
Rais: Poor Crane! So consumed with emotion.
Rais: Burning with the need for revenge...
Rais: Eaten alive by hatred.
Rais: Such feelings make you WEAK.

------------
Rais' demise
------------
Rais: So... face to face again. I guess that means I don't need this anymore...
Crane: With or without it, Suleiman, you're dead.
Rais: Come now, Crane. Do not pretend you don't care. How many lives depend on
this disc? Hundreds? Thousands? ... Perhaps BILLIONS?
Rais: You are right about one thing, Crane...
Rais: ... Suleiman is dead!
Rais: He died with his brother. In this city.
Rais: You don't even belong here. You don't know what suffering is.
Rais: I will teach you, Crane... you will suffer alongside me!
Rais: Yes... Go on... You cannot resist... Do it. I won't fight you. Just as
you killed Tahir - DO IT.
Crane: F*ck you, *sshole. You want me to make my own rules? Here's rule #1:
you're gonna spend the rest of your godd*mn life in f*ck*ng agony.
Rais: Do not... leave me like this, Crane.
Rais: Prove you are a man. Take your vengeance!
Crane: God, will you just SHUT THE F*CK UP!
(Rais: Crane!)
Rais: How the tables have turned... in the blink of an eye. If I were trapped
in Harran, this wound would have killed me.
Rais: But now YOU dangle on the edge of life and death, while the GRE wait to
take ME to a hospital.
Rais: I give you... the HONOR... of deciding your own fate. Hand me the disc...
so that there is at least a CHANCE that Harran might live... and I will make
your death painless.
Rais: Or resist, and doom the city along with you. You have until the count of
five.
Rais: One... two... 
Crane: All right! All right! Here!
Crane: How's THAT for a decision? *sshole.

Crane: What do you want?
GRE: Rais already told us he had that dead scientist's data. All we're
interested in is the cure. We're offering you a chance, here!
GRE: Get the rest of the research and come with us!
Crane: I can think of a lot of reasons to tell you to go f*ck yourself, but why
don't we pretend for a minute that you DON'T think I'm stupid?
Crane: You need the cure. It's here, in the city... somewhere. And as long as
it is, you won't try to pull any Ministry-style b*llsh*t.
GRE: Crane, why do you even GIVE a f*ck what happens to these people? You don't
belong here! This is just a job for you!
Crane: (No.) Not anymore, it's not... I'll be in touch when I've decided what
to do next.
Camden: Crane? Can you hear me? It's Camden!
Crane: Yeah, I hear you. What's going on, Doc?
Camden: The analysis just finished on the tissue samples! The results are...
well, I don't think the word "phenomenal" is too strong!
Camden: Crane, if you can recover Zere's data, I'm CERTAIN a cure is within
reach!
Crane: All right.
Crane: We'll talk about it next time I see you.
